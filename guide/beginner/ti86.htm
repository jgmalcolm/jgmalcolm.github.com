<P>The TI86 has a screen of 128 by 64 pixels. That makes room for
8 rows of 21 large characters. The operating system it runs is
called TI-OS. TI bumped it up the processor to run at about 4.8 MHz.

<P>Because everyone makes mistakes, TI has tried to fix theirs
by putting out several changes to their internal software.
