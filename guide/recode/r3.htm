	<TR>	<TD CLASS=header>Error
		<TD>There are two errors in this.  For the first one, you wouldn't
		be able to see it if you hadn't looked at the
		<A HREF="../opcodes/opcodes.htm">opcode list</A> to see that
		<CODE>ld (<I>arg1</I>),bc</CODE> takes up 4 bytes where as <CODE>ld
		(<I>arg1</I>),hl</CODE> only takes up 3.  If you wait a second to
		load <CODE>hl</CODE> with the string address, you can use <CODE>hl</CODE> to
		set up the cursor coordinates, thus saving one byte. Speed really
		isn't a factor here, but, for every one less byte the processor
		has to read in your code, it is a little faster.  We can't
		use <CODE>hl</CODE> to save this byte for our second string because, as I will
		explain in the second error, <CODE>hl</CODE> is holding the address of our
		second string.  The second error comes
		when you load <CODE>hl</CODE> with the address of the second string.  You
		don't have to do this after the last <CODE>_vputs</CODE>.  After
		<CODE>_vputs</CODE> is done, <CODE>hl</CODE> is at the address of the
		byte after the zero terminate which, in this case, is the first
		letter of our second string.
