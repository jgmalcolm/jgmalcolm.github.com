      of Peachtree Place NW.  Take a left out of the station heading toward
      Peachtree St.  Take a right onto Peachtree St heading toward 860
      Peachtree St.</p>

      <p><b>From Emory.</b> Take Ponce de Leon heading West toward downtown.
      Take a right onto Peachtree St.  Take a left on 7th street (Starbucks
      will be on your right as you turn), and park in the visitor deck on your
      left.</p>

      <p><b>From I75 heading south.</b> Take exit 250 for 10th/14th/17th
      street.  Pass through 17th and stay in the left lane to take a left onto
      10th.  In three blocks, take a right onto Peachtree St.  In three
      blocks, take a right onto 7th street (Starbucks will be on your left as

      <p>The map below shows a green star for the building which has pay
      parking on the bottom two floors. Free parking is available on Juniper
      St on a first-come, first-served basis.  There are also two pay lots at
      the corners of Peachtree & 7th and Peachtree & 6th.</p>

      <p>You can enter the building from inside the parking deck (entrance on
      the 2nd level), or by the Peachtree St main entrance.  The concierge
      will buzz you up to the 21st floor, and my unit is #2103.</p>
