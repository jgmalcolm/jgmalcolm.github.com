* Before

  * The more time you put into pre-negotiations the better.
    * In the moment, you'll be able to calmly evaluate trade-offs because
      you've already evaluated these options.  You'll have pre-formulated
      responses ready.
      * You'll know what's important to you, and what you can giveaway for
        leverage.
      * Similarly, figure out what's important to the other party and where
        you two might run into conflict.
    * During the negotiation, the more time you spend thinking, the less time
      you're reading the other party.
    * Have this all written down and organized so you don't misspeak and
      you're consistent in ongoing negotiations
      * If you state a price range, it's hard to readjust expectations at a
        different range.
    * Time spent here differentiates the top negotiators from the good ones.

  * Determine what's reasonable and what's your max and min range around that.
    * Is there any way you can estimate what's reasonable?
      * Compare to a similar good or service
      * Use another industry or product for proxy numbers
    * What's the maximum you'd be willing to pay?
    * What's the minimum you think is reasonable to offer without offending?


* Determine what's important and what's giveaway
  * Make a list of the things that are non-negotiable from your perspective.
    * Rank order them.
  * Make a list of things you can give/take on to sweeten the deal for the
    other party.
    * Things you start out strong on but back away in order to gain ground on
      more important items.
    * If you reach an impasse, throw one of these in to grease the wheels.
    * Examples of things you might be flexible on
      * Payment terms: paying more upfront or a shorter invoice payment
        turnaround so the other party sees cash flow sooner.
      * Dates: loosen the time table to add flexibility and decrease stress
      * Quality: lower quality expectations to gain ground on pricing,
        conversely require higher quality if price is unable to come down.
    * Make three lists: Must Have, Nice To Have, and Give Away.
      * You need to get all the Must Haves on the table in your initial
        discussions.  This gives the other party the full scope of what you
        want out of the deal.  If you fail to mention one and bring it up
        later, it forces the other party to have to rework their decision
        calculus which puts unnecessary friction in the process.
      * Nice To Have are often best left until after there is general
        agreement on the Must Have items.  These can also be left for the
        "Needling" phase.
      * Give Away items can be tossed in when discussion stalls and you need
        to get some momentum or leverage.
      * Spend time comparing them so you have a feel for relative value.

## Name your price, or not.

When should you be the first to signal a price, and when should you let the
other party anchor?

* Goal is to arrive at maximum utility for all parties.
  * Emphasize this throughout the discussion to assure the other parties that
    you're trying to work with them.

* Every time I walk away from a negotiation, I feel I could have driven a
  harder deal.  But I rest in the fact that I won't want to be a jerk.  Very
  often I'm trying to broker a long-term working relationship.
