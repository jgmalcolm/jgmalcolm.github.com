* Before

  * The more time you put into pre-negotiations the better.
    * In the moment, you'll be able to calmly evaluate trade-offs because
      you've already evaluated these options.  You'll have pre-formulated
      responses ready.
      * You'll know what's important to you, and what you can giveaway for
        leverage.
      * Similarly, figure out what's important to the other party and where
        you two might run into conflict.
    * During the negotiation, the more time you spend thinking, the less time
      you're reading the other party.
    * Time spent here differentiates the top negotiators from the good ones.
    * Have this all written down and organized so you don't misspeak and
      you're consistent in ongoing negotiations
      * If you throw out a price range, it's hard to readjust expectations at
        a different range.

  * Determine what's reasonable and what's your max and min range around that.
    * Is there any way you can estimate what's reasonable?
      * Compare to a similar good or service
      * Use another industry or product for proxy numbers
    * What's the maximum you'd be willing to pay?
    * What's the minimum you think is reasonable to offer without offending?


* Determine what's important and what's giveaway
  * Make a list of the things that are non-negotiable from your perspective.
    * Rank order them.
  * Make a list of things you can give/take on to sweeten the deal for the
    other party.
    * Things you start out strong on but back away in order to gain ground on
      more important items.
    * If you reach an impasse, throw one of these in to grease the wheels.
    * Examples of things you might be flexible on
      * Payment terms: paying more upfront or a shorter invoice payment
        turnaround so the other party sees cash flow sooner.
      * Dates: loosen the time table to add flexibility and decrease stress
      * Quality: lower quality expectations to gain ground on pricing,
        conversely require higher quality if price is unable to come down.

When to name a price and when to let the other party name a price.


* Goal is to arrive at maximum utility for all parties.
  * Emphasize this throughout the discussion to assure the other parties that
    you're trying to work with them.

* Every time I walk away from a negotiation, I feel I could have driven a
  harder deal.  But I rest in the fact that I won't want to be a jerk.  Very
  often I'm trying to broker a long-term working relationship.
