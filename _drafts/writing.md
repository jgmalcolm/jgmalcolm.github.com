write in the following order: abstract first and last

1. abstract (draft)
1. figures and tables
1. methods, results, discussion
1. conclusions and introduction
1. abstract and title


# Title

- will immediately give reviewer a gut feeling for accept/reject
- state main finding
- avoid technical jargon
  - wide reader catchment
- good and bad examples


# Abstract

- should stand alone
- will solidify or dissolve the reviewer's level of interest
  - by the end, reviewers probably decide whether reject or resubmit


# Introduction

- why should we care
- give perspective
- introduce main issues
- two paragraphs
  - first: give perspective
  - second: clearly state 1-2 clinical questions that form goal of study
- bad examples
  - including discussion, conclusion, results
  - history lessons better left to a review
  - oversell - 'novel', 'unique', 'first ever'


# Methods

- knowledgeable reader must be able to reproduce experiments
  - details, lots of details
  - consider supplementary materials


# Results

- only essential results
- consider supplementary materials
- subheadings to group
- clearly answer questions at end of introduction
- order should mirror abstract & methods


# Figures

- use color sparingly
  - consider different line styles so looks okay in b&w
- include necessary color/intensity scales


# Discussion

- talk to the audience
- do not introduce any new results here not already in results section
- compare your results to published results
- important to reference papers with different conclusions
  - if you don't include and reviewer finds, it will sink you because reviewer
    wonders 'what else is missing?'


# Conclusions

- how does your work advance the field
- do not repeat abstract or list experimental results
- indicate applications or future directions or anything you are currently
  working on


# Acknowledgments

- advisors, proof-readers, anyone who helped conduct experiments but may not
  have been justified a co-author spot


# References

- Mendeley, EndNote
- while writing, don't get bogged down (Smith2002, Johnson2010)
- too many references means you're unfocused
- too few and you haven't done homework
- look at representative papers to judge appropriate count



# Responding to reviewers

- create a document with the reviews verbatim, reformat to be bold/italics,
  and answer inline with normal font
- make a separate checklist for you and co-authors, ordered by importance
  - keep going down that list until you judge not important
  - justify everything below that line
- start by thanking reviewer and highlighting what you appreciate
- never argue, guarantees failure
- reviewers may be quick/sloppy but they are never stupid and they are always
  "right"
- try to answer everything, but okay for minor points to acknowledge and
  justify not addressing.  Better to say you considered something and, while
  you didn't do exactly what is suggested, you did something similar.
