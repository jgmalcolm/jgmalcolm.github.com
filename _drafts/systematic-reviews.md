If you're finding a lot of papers reporting on the question, then you're
likely on a valuable topic.

Don't read into the papers too much.  Not every paper will report on every
variable you're interested in.  If the paper doesn't record an outcome measure
that you're looking for, then move on.  You don't have time to wade through
their raw data and make your own interpretations.  Only record what they
record so you stay unbiased.  There's always a balance, but as much as
possible, you need to "delegate" and rely on their clinical assessment.
