## Get Organized

Use [Google Docs](drive.google.com) for real-time collaboration on
spreadsheets and comments to keep in sync.  Use [Mendeley](mendeley.com) for
citations and integrating with Microsoft Word.  Turn off the feature that
pushes your PDFs to the cloud; it's unnecessary, seems to cause duplication,
and you'll always stay within the free pricing tier.


## Scope

If you're finding a lot of papers reporting on the question, then you're
likely on a valuable topic.

Lumpers and splitters.



## Avoid getting bogged down

**Don't read into things too much.** Not every paper will report on every
variable you're interested in.  If the paper doesn't record an outcome measure
that you're looking for, then move on.  You don't have time to wade through
their raw data and make your own interpretations.  Only record what they
record so you stay unbiased.  There's always a balance, but as much as
possible, you need to "delegate" and rely on their clinical assessment.

**Focus on one thing at a time.** After you skim a few related papers on your
topic, you should have an idea on what are the main risk factors,
complications, or whatever else all the papers make a fuss about.  Take a pass
through all papers and just focus on this one variable so you develop
judgment.  You'll flounder if you try to go through every paper and record
every single detail into twenty different columns.  You'll quickly get lost in
the minutia.  As you're reading papers, it's easy to go down rabbit trails
with new references you've not yet seen; you should put those in a separate
list for later.



# Data Analysis

The Cochrane Collaboration has released
[RevMan](http://tech.cochrane.org/revman) for you to produce
[Forest plots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_plot) that show the
synthesis of your data.

# Writing

**Methods.** Write this section first.  It should be the most straight
forward: you're just documenting what you did.  Look at other papers to see
what is important to document and in what order.  Follow the
[PRISMA](http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000100) formula, but don't
get too bogged down with all the details; do as much as you can and move on.
No study hits all points but you should aim for something like 60-70% of the
items.

**Introduction.** Make this brief, like two paragraphs.  First paragraph is
broad strokes introducing the topic and a few notable works.  This is not a
discussion; it is merely an introduction of topics.  Second paragraph
motivates your work:  what question are you seeking to answer?  You must have
a good motivation, not simply "Previous studies suck. I could do better."

**Discussion.** Break it into sections for each of the topics.  For each
topic, highlight papers that found significant findings, even if you
ultimately found no significance.  Don't spend time on things that were not
significant.  This is an opportunity to highlight the signal among all the
noise.  You don't need to wring every nugget from each paper; just highlight
one takeaway for each.

**Citations.** Don't get caught up in citations; it can distract from your
communication.  Focus first on saying what you want to say in the order you
want to say it; then later integrate citations.
