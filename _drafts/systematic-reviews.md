## Get Organized

Google Docs for collaboration.


## Scope

If you're finding a lot of papers reporting on the question, then you're
likely on a valuable topic.

Lumpers and splitters.



## Avoid getting bogged down

**Don't read into things too much.** Not every paper will report on every
variable you're interested in.  If the paper doesn't record an outcome measure
that you're looking for, then move on.  You don't have time to wade through
their raw data and make your own interpretations.  Only record what they
record so you stay unbiased.  There's always a balance, but as much as
possible, you need to "delegate" and rely on their clinical assessment.

**Focus on one thing at a time.** After you skim a few related papers on your
topic, you should have an idea on what are the main risk factors,
complications, or whatever else all the papers make a fuss about.  Take a pass
through all papers and just focus on this one variable so you develop
judgment.  You'll flounder if you try to go through every paper and record
every single detail into twenty different columns.  You'll quickly get lost in
the minutia.  As you're reading papers, it's easy to go down rabbit trails
with new references you've not yet seen; you should put those in a separate
list for later.
