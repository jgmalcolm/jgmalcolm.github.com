# Target Your Leading Journal

- Pick the journal for your field
- review the latest issue
- find one paper you like the most
  - needs to be a review paper or meta-analysis or else you have to get patient data from home institution
  - if you don't find one, go back one issue
  - rinse and repeat until you have an article that you're interested in
- study it hard
  - print it out, mark it up
  - typically do digital, but here you want to study this big time
- avoid rabbit trails of hunting down citations 1,2,3,4,... just yet
  - mark citations in the back as you think they're important, but don't hunt any down just yet
  - at the end, pick 3 most important and hunt & study them less intensely
- start a new document with the (blank) outline from the article you're studying
  - abstract, intro, methods, results, figure 1, table 1, figure 2, etc. discussion
  - for every table / figure, start a spreadsheet with that data


# Target Your Main Conferences

- start a document with all the upcoming conferences and their dates for the coming 12 months
- for each conference, you're going to bullet point the tentative abstract/project you intend to submit
- this will evolve over time
  - rearrange as needed
- share this with your advisor so they always know your direction
- hyperlink to the document containing the current version of the submission
- down below it all, start a catch all "to be determined" with long term ideas/plans


# Target Your Seniors

- Who are the big names in your program that work in areas you find interesting?
- what do you think of their latest work?
- how can you align your topic interests with theirs?
- use that to approach them to mentor you
- Which junior and senior residents do you want to work with?
  - start making connections and think of ways to include them as co-authors
