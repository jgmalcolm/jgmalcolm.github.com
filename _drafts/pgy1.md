## Consults


## Night float

When leaving hospital in morning, take 3mg melatonin to kick start your sleep
cycle by the time you get home.


Anyone who you get worried about to the point of doing frequent checks,
consider transfer to ICU. Don't rely on nursing staff to report back. Don't
rely on yourself to keep checking; you may get pulled into something else.
