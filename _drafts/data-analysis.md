**Preserve raw data.** Alter your original data as little as
possible. Sometimes you'll want to go back and re-interpret something, but
once you've transformed it, you cannot go back. Add new columns for data
transforms, and hide the original data columns.

**Focus on 1-3 variables at a time.** When you're populating a spreadsheet for
case series or something where you touch a lot of individual records, focus on
one or two variables at once.  If you try to run through filling out every
column for each record, you'll get distracted and be inconsistent the further
you go.  Pick 1-3 related variables and just extract those in one pass.
You'll quickly develop good clinical judgment, and can easily go back to
repeat earlier entries for consistency as you learn.  Temporarily hide all
other columns.
