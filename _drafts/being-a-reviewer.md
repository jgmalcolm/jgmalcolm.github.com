title: "Being a reviewer"
description: "How to accurately and efficiently critique a journal manuscript"

goal: you want to ultimately only review for 1-2 journals as your career
matures because you want to be in the position to be considered an
associate/topic editor and maybe ultimately the editor-in-chief.  Reviewing
for 5+ random journals gets you experience but does not build your reputation
with any one group.  Focus on making friends with a few editors.

Email editors to offer your services.  They always need reviewers.  If your CV
and background are appropriate, they will put you on the short list and maybe
throw you a quick review or two.
