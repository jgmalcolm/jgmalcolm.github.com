## Year by year

**Pre-STEP1.**

**Clerkships.**

**Senior year.**



## Finding a program

**Ask your attendings and residents.** Residents have the freshest perspective
  while attendings have the best view from the top. Online rankings like
  Doximity and US News & World Report tend to be out of touch with the ground
  reality because they try to be very macro in order to evaluate every
  program.

**Avoid ranking too early in your mind.** Until you've done some
  sub-internships away and interviewed, you really don't know much about the
  landscape.  Avoid coming to harsh black and white judgements on programs
  until you've visited.  Instead, make some rough groupings and remain open
  minded.

**Rank on multiple factors.** When it does come to ranking, consider more than
  just prestige. Look at what the city offers, the chemistry of the residents
  you met there, how the faculty treated you, the facility, what your home
  attendings and residents think, etc. Prestige ranking tends to trail reality
  by five years.



## Publications

**Submit early.** For a publication to make it on your application in
  September of your fourth year, it needs to be submitted during second and
  third year.  It can take anywhere between 3-9 months to get something
  published.  For your target journal, look at some sample published articles
  to see "Received" and "Accepted" times.

**Get involved in 2-3 projects.** Any more and you tend to be spread
  thin. You'll have a bunch of "bosses" that are all wondering why you're not
  doing that much.  Better instead to work with two faculty and 1-2 projects
  per faculty.  This builds in buffer in case something doesn't get published
  in time.

**Lead some, help some.** Take the lead (first author) on some project, and
  help on some others.  Learn what it takes for each role.  First authorship
  means a lot more than coauthor #2-4. First author means you took it across
  the finish line.


## Clinical Experience

**Follow residents around anytime you're free.** There is always someone on
  call. Text/page them to find where you can meet them.  If it's a busy
  weekend/night, you'll likely get to scrub in and help a lot.  If it's quiet,
  you'll likely have some time for picking the resident's brain on what life
  is like. Regardless, spending time with these future colleagues will help
  you know if it's right for you.

**Watch surgical videos.** Several collections online:

## Choosing away rotations

- Where you rotate will open/close geographic regions.  If you do your aways
  all on east coast, then don't bank on any west coast interviews.
- Away rotations boost your chances of matching at the program, so pick
  schools that you believe you like and you think are a reach.  Don't rotate
  anywhere beneath your home program.  I've heard Medicine students say
  rotating can only hurt you; the reverse is true in neurosurgery.  Programs
  are much more comfortable taking a resident they've worked with for a month
  than one they've only met for interview.
- It might be easier to get a rotation spot than it is to get an interview.

## Interview season

- PGY5s
- any faculty interaction is better than not meeting -- it gives them a face
  to associate
- Facebook group
- Chat with everyone because you never know where you'll end up but you will
  cross paths again.
- Split hotels, airport rides, etc. with other applicants

## Second looks

- Try to pick different programs than where you did away rotations.
  Presumably you've already done the best you can to solidify your reputation
  while on your away + interview.  Use second look to increase your changes at
  other programs.
