# Choosing away rotations

- Where you rotate will open/close geographic regions.  If you do your aways
  all on east coast, then don't bank on any west coast interviews.
- Away rotations boost your chances of matching at the program, so pick
  schools that you believe you like and you think are a reach.  Don't rotate
  anywhere beneath your home program.  I've heard Medicine students say
  rotating can only hurt you; the reverse is true in neurosurgery.  Programs
  are much more comfortable taking a resident they've worked with for a month
  than one they've only met for interview.
- It might be easier to get a rotation spot than it is to get an interview.

# Interview season

- PGY5s
- any faculty interaction is better than not meeting -- it gives them a face
  to associate
- Facebook group
- Chat with everyone because you never know where you'll end up but you will
  cross paths again.
- Split hotels

# Second looks

- Try to pick different programs than where you did away rotations.
  Presumably you've already done the best you can to solidify your reputation
  while on your away + interview.  Use second look to increase your changes at
  other programs.
