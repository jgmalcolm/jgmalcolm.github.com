Publications
- need to be submitted during third year to be published in time for September
  applications
  - can take anywhere between 3-9mo to get something published
  - for your target journal, look at published articles to see example
    "Received" and "Accepted" times


## Sub-intern advice

* Never complain about being tired or stressed in front of residents or
  attendings.  Their lives are way harder than yours.
* Listen for any mention of something needing to get done, and jump on it.
* Study the surgical cases you'll see tomorrow.  Even just 10 minutes will pay
  off.  Learn one important step you'll watch for the next day.
* Prepare answers for the obvious questions: Why neurosurgery? What's your
  research about?


- Delman's three qualities
  - integrity
  - compassion
  - passion


Be useful but not too helpful
- jumping in to answer a before thinking, often realized the correct answer a second later
- reach too quickly to grab an OR instrument, you scare people when you move too fast

Learn to anticipate
- they grab suture, you grab scissors.  But know the difference between
  sutures they're tying for retraction and those they want cut, and when they
  want them cut. Line up the fascial sutures and cut in one go.
- they grab drill, you grab irrigation
- suction unmanned because they have their hands full, pick it up
- learn glove sizes for residents and attendings so you can pull gloves. Write
  this on a 3x5 card for your pocket.


falling asleep in a lecture or conference, start writing... write any and all
thoughts because it somehow keeps you awake.


# Away rotations

- Where you rotate will open/close geographic regions.  If you do your aways
  all on east coast, then don't bank on any west coast interviews.
- Away rotations boost your chances of matching at the program, so pick
  schools that you believe you like and you think are a reach.  Don't rotate
  anywhere beneath your home program.  I've heard Medicine students say
  rotating can only hurt you; the reverse is true in neurosurgery.  Programs
  are much more comfortable taking a resident they've worked with for a month
  than one they've only met for interview.
- It might be easier to get a rotation spot than it is to get an interview.


# Second looks

- Try to pick different programs than where you did away rotations.
  Presumably you've already done the best you can to solidify your reputation
  while on your away + interview.  Use second look to increase your changes at
  other programs.
