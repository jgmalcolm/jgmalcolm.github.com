## Sub-intern advice

* Never complain about being tired or stressed in front of residents or
  attendings.  Their lives are way harder than yours.
* Listen for any mention of something needing to get done, and jump on it.
* Study the surgical cases you'll see tomorrow.  Even just 10 minutes will pay
  off.  Learn one important step you'll watch for the next day.
* Prepare answers for the obvious questions: Why neurosurgery? What's your
  research about?


- Delman's three qualities
  - integrity
  - compassion
  - passion


Be useful
Learn to anticipate
- they grab suture, you grab scissors.  But know the difference between
  sutures they're tying for retraction and those they want cut, and when they
  want them cut. Line up the fascial sutures and cut in one go.
- they grab drill, you grab irrigation
- suction unmanned because they have their hands full, pick it up

falling asleep in a lecture or conference, start writing... write any and all
thoughts because it somehow keeps you awake.
