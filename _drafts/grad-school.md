You're only stupid enough to get a PhD once.  Here are some lessons learned
and advice.

## Work on important projects

Whatever you do, make sure it's worth it.  You want your time and energy to
make a difference.  It's so easy to work on projects that are technically
feasible but have no consequence on the world.  This will be some of the most
focused and productive years of your life, so make them count.

At the start, you're likely to get swept up in some "awesome" project your
advisor or a senior student dreams up.  This may seem like a grind and you
might not be able to step out.  If that's the case, then keep at it and keep
your eyes open for opportunities to breakout in new interesting directions.
Use the experience to learn your tools.

[Richard Hamming][] gave a famous lecture entitled
["You and your research"][hamming-txt] ([video][hamming-vid]).  I highly
recommend pouring over his advice.  Among the many gems in there, one I want
to highlight here is how he would have lunch with people from other
departments.  Often he would raise the question "What are the important
problems in your field?"  And soon after that he would prod by asking why they
weren't working on the important problems?  Questions like this get under your
skin.  He wasn't welcomed at the lunch table anymore.

## Follow rockstars (in any field)
  - study their techniques and writing
  - every year, understand the Nobel and be able to explain to friends and family

## Find a rockstar advisor
  - one of the biggest success factors outside your control
  - find a young and hungry one, a few years out from tenure
    - pipeline
  - query their students and other faculty
  - review their publications
  - review their trajectory
  - get senior, connected advisors on your committee

## Create a blog
  - practice effective communication
  - evolve your thinking
  - personal website == personal brand
    - don't start advertising yourself at the end
  - great way to show your advisor what you're up to
  - can do without spilling the beans on your upcoming papers

## Use source control
  - version both code and data
  - get your research group involved
    - private repos for non-public stuff
  - show your advisor progress, accept updates/edits
    - pay for private repos?
  - https://github.com/blog/1840-improving-github-for-science
  - https://authorea.com/users/3/articles/3904/_show_article
  - collaboration
    - papers in source control
    - Google docs for non-technical collaboration, drafting
      - track changes
    - https://www.writelatex.com
    - Mendeley

## Publish code
  - every paper has an SHA
  - [spread the word about your code][spread]
  - open source http://tom.preston-werner.com/2011/11/22/open-source-everything.html

## Every project needs its own page
  - for the lay and technical
  - papers
    - .TeX
    - figures -> presentations
    - BibTeX
  - code & ?data
    - reproducible experiments!
  - more likely to get cited
  - more likely for others to build upon

## Contribute to Wikipedia
  - provide a road map for newbies and generations to come
  - promote important discoveries and techniques
  - organize your own thoughts

## Papers and publishing
  - work backward from conference location
  - read papers from last year's conference in which you want to publish
    - know the bar
    - [lankton-rss]
  - be sure to cite relevant members of program committee
  - co-authorship, friends

## Writing
  - http://www.shawnlankton.com/2008/02/use-that-sweet-spot
  - http://www.shawnlankton.com/2007/09/formula-to-write-a-paper

## Productivity
  - top students
  - focus
  - time
  - balance

Hamming:

> Knowledge and productivity are like compound interest. Given two people of
> approximately the same ability and one person who works ten percent more
> than the other, the latter will more than twice outproduce the former. The
> more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do;
> the more you can do, the more the opportunity - it is very much like
> compound interest.


## Thesis
  - repurpose the intro into book chapters (advisor connections)

## Defense

## Career
  - industry vs postdoc [r01-rate]
  - consulting http://www.shawnlankton.com/2009/08/getting-a-consulting-job-0
  - Hamming

## What can I say I learned from it all?
  - problem solving
  - no fear or intimidation of ideas or science
  - develop a long term research plan with milestones
  - develop convincing experiments
  - persuasive writing


## My story

I completed a PhD in medical imaging and computer vision with the Department
of [Electrical & Computer Engineering](http://ece.gatech.edu) at Georgia Tech.
My advisors provided excellent guidance and support in both life and academia:
[Yogesh Rathi][] (co-advisor) and [Allen Tannenbaum][] (co-advisor).  My
committee included some of the most superb scientists I have ever worked with:
[Tony Yezzi][], [Patricio Vela][], and [Sylvain Bouix][].  I had the
opportunity to focus on diffusion MRI as a research fellow at
[Brigham and Women's Hospital][pnl].  You can see more about the
[techniques][projects] and [papers][] we developed.

During the course of all of that, I worked with fellow students
[Gallagher Pryor][] and [John Melonakos][] to build [Jacket][] and
[ArrayFire][], both software libraries for high performance technical
computing.  I'm now pursuing a lifelong dream as a medical student in Atlanta.
