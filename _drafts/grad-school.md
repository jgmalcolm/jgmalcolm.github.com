You're only stupid enough to get a PhD once.  Here are some lessons learned
and advice.

- Work on important projects
  - even if starting on a grinding project, use the experience to know the tools and keep your eyes open
  - Richard Hamming
  - follow rockstars (in any field)
    - study their techniques and writing
    - every year, understand the Nobel and be able to explain to friends and family
- Find a rockstar advisor
  - query their students and other faculty
- Create a blog
  - practice effective communication
  - evolve your thinking
  - personal website == personal brand
    - don't start advertising yourself at the end
  - great way to show your advisor what you're up to
  - can do without spilling the beans on your upcoming papers
- Use source control
  - version both code and data
  - get your research group involved
    - private repos for non-public stuff
  - show your advisor progress, accept updates/edits
    - pay for private repos?

# My story

I completed a PhD in medical imaging and computer vision with the Department
of [Electrical & Computer Engineering](http://ece.gatech.edu) at Georgia Tech.
My advisors provided excellent guidance and support in both life and academia:
[Yogesh Rathi][] (co-advisor) and [Allen Tannenbaum][] (co-advisor).  My
committee included some of the most superb scientists I have ever worked with:
[Tony Yezzi][], [Patricio Vela][], and [Sylvain Bouix][].  I had the
opportunity to focus on diffusion MRI as a research fellow at
[Brigham and Women's Hospital][pnl].  You can see more about the
[techniques][projects] and [papers][] we developed.

During the course of all of that, I worked with fellow students
[Gallagher Pryor][] and [John Melonakos][] to build [Jacket][] and
[ArrayFire][], both software libraries for high performance technical
computing.  I'm now pursuing a lifelong dream as a medical student in Atlanta.
