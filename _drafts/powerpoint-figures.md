- Each figure has its own PPT.  This lets you set guidelines for each figure
  independently.
- Set slide size to intended output size.  For example, if you intend for your
  figure to be half a column of a 8x11" paper with 1" margins, then set its
  width to be half of 7" (or 3.5") and set its height to something reasonable.
  Doesn't have to be exact, just ballpark because the copy-editing later can
  squeeze.
- Set guidelines for multi-panel figures.  This lets you snap edges tight.
  Get out your calculator and figure out exact proportions and panel sizes for
  these guidelines.
- Use color sparingly to indicate important areas of focus.  For example, for
  a medical image of a cancerous lesion in a larger picture of an organ, then
  put an arrow pointing to the actual lesion.  Use lighter colors which show
  up well on black-and-white printers (eg. green, yellow).
- For each figure panel: insert your image, set the crop to the panel
  boundaries, then move and resize. Hold shift while resizing to maintain
  aspect ratio.
- Once your images are imported into your PPT, you can optionally delete the
  original images since PPT stores the originals internally.
