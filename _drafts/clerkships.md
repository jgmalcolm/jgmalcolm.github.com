## Every rotation

Equipment: several pens (be prepared to give them away), pen light, note
cards, stethoscope, [scutsheets](http://www.medfools.com/downloads.php).

Surgery likely doesn't need your stethoscope.  Psych probably doesn't need
anything beyond pens; leave your tie and white coat at home so a patient
doesn't strangle you or get intimidated.  An ophthalmoscope is handy on
consult services where you're unlikely to have tools handy.

Ditch Wikipedia for [UpToDate.com](//uptodate.com).  This is the most
well-organized resource I've found for efficient, practical, and comprehensive
research on topics encountered in clinical medicine.


## Neurology

**Pregame.** Specific equipment for the physical exam:  reflex hammer, tuning
fork, safety pins, ophthalmoscope. Practice your complete neuro exam multiple
times.  Review anti-epileptic drugs for seizure control and pain management,
calcium channel blockers for treating vasospasm, beta blockers for lowing
blood pressure, and anesthetics.

**Shelf.** About 200 questions in UWorld and 500 in
[Neurology Pre-Test][]. I've heard [Neurology Clinical Cases][] is good but I
had my hands full with UWorld and Pre-Test.
