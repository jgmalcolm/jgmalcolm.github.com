## Every rotation

Equipment: multiple pens (be prepared to give them away), pen light, note
cards, stethoscope, [scutsheets](http://www.medfools.com/downloads.php).

Surgery likely doesn't need your stethoscope.  Psych probably doesn't need
anything beyond pens; leave your tie and white coat at home.

## Neurology

**Pregame.** Grab copies of [Neurology Clinical Cases][] and
[Neurology Pre-Test][].  Specific equipment for the physical exam: reflex
hammer, safety pins, pen light.  Optional equipment: ophthalmoscope, tuning
fork. Practice your complete neuro exam multiple times.
