Here's how I brew my daily coffee to have the smoothest, richest coffee
flavor, moderate caffeine levels, and far less bitter acidity.

**It all starts yesterday morning.** That's right: yesterday morning was when
I started today's coffee.  When I am pouring my hot coffee for today, I'm also
making my coffee for tomorrow.  It's a 24-hour cycle.

* Today: Pour fresh grinds and filtered water into French press. Place that in
  refrigerator for tomorrow.
* Tomorrow: Press the French press and microwave in large Pyrex measuring cup.
  Meanwhile, rinse and refill French press for next day.

"Toddy claims to brew up two-thirds less caffeine than regular coffee;
in a side-by side test using Starbucks' regular blend, the Toddy
version had a pH of 6.31 and 40 mg of caffeine per 100 grams of
coffee, while Starbucks store-brewed clocked in at a pH of 5.48 and 61
mg of caffeine."

  "It turns out that coffee is high in chlorogenic acid, which, as the
  coffee cools, forms quinic acid, which has a noteable and
  overwhelming astringent flavor. So the task is to brew coffee in a
  way that does not involve heat, and also reduces the apparent
  acidity. In the 60's the Toddy method became popular and it produces
  a finished product that is notably less bitter and actually puts
  forward a deep caramel and chocolaty flavor. It is perfect for a
  warm day."
