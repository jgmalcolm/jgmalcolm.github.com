* First Aid: http://www.amazon.com/First-USMLE-Step-2014-Series/dp/0071831428
  (referred to as First Aid or FA) and
  http://www.amazon.com/First-Basic-Sciences-VALUE-USMLE/dp/0071785744
   * at start of school, purchase Basic Sciences
   * through Healthy Human, use a current FA
   * purchase new FA when it comes out (December), use that until Step 1
      * give your old copy to an underclassman
   * Consolidate resources: don't buy every book out there, experiment some to
     find what works for you, but ultimately settle on a few resources and
     know them thoroughly.  It's easy to be fooled into thinking buying a
     resource will improve your score; only time spent learning will improve
     your score.  (thank Jason Boulter)

## Videos

* YouTube channels
* [Handwritten Tutorials](//handwrittentutorials.com)
  ([YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/harpinmartin)).


## Spaced Repetition

* https://firecracker.me - like Anki but pre-populated with First Aid material
   * read up on Spaced Repetition: http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition
   * purchase either:
      * 18 months at start of school ($375)
      * 12 months during Prologue 1, extend 1-2 months if you need when the
        time comes
   * If youre overwhelmed in starting out, consider using Normal mode (in
     settings) to limit it to key topics.  Youll want to move to Legendary at
     some point, but this might make it a little less daunting to start.
   * For information youve never seen, mark as Forgot (1)
      * Pause and just skim the information because you need to learn this
        stuff anyway.  Try to learn one little piece from that question.  For
        now breeze through it.
      * You will come back to these questions in the months before STEP
      * If you skip, youll just accumulate cards.
   * use the keyboard shortcuts (when youre doing a quiz, theres a little
     laptop icon on the bottom right)
   * as you cover material (daily/weekly) you add it to the question pool
     (flag it)
   * this does include NBME-style questions but they are not as high quality
     as Kaplan, USMLE-Rx, and UWorld
   * How I use Firecracker
      * 1-5 ratings - theyre a self assessment, and youll soon get comfortable
        with what they mean to you.  Heres my thinking:
         * never seen, completely forgot, messed it up royal, want to see
           tomorrow 1
            * if you missed an important part of the answer and want to retest
              tomorrow
         * got most of it, some recall, want to see it in 2-3 days 2
            * if you missed an important part of the answer and think you can
              wait a few days to retest
         * got most of it, reasoned guess was correct, want to see it in 4-5
           days 3
         * got all but one or two details, see it in a week 4
         * knew it perfectly, minor detail missed that you dont think is
           important 5
         * In general: I use 1,2 a lot while Im learning.  3 if something is
           shakey.  Using 4-5 will quickly push things out too far into the
           horizon. I only use 5 if I have something down and I want to push
           it out on the order of weeks.
      * If youre coming to the party late (a few months/year into medical
        school), then youll have a lot of catching up to do.  Youll want to
        eventually have everything flagged that youve touched on in school.
        Itll be an overwhelming number of questions and theres no excuse but
        to put in time slogging through so the algorithm calibrates what you
        know and what you dont know.  Just put in the time.  Theres no
        substitute.
         * On the Study Plan dashboard
           (https://med.firecracker.me/study_plan), under Do Questions choose
           More Options (https://med.firecracker.me/quiz/advanced) Do Fewer
           Questions uncheck everything select a topic like Pulmonology to
           focus your questions.
         * While Im in a module, I find the algorithm doesnt feed me enough
           questions daily (it is focused on long term and not backward
           planning from your module exam), so Ill go Do More Questions
           <Module> All Days and get a few hundred questions to pound through.
            * You need to have everything flagged (ie. first pass in studying)
              by about into the module, that way the algorithm spends the last
              of your module focusing in on what you dont know in that whole
              big pile.
            * The last week of a module should all be daily maintenance of FC
              questions and full qbank assault.  During exam week, FC may only
              be feeding you 10-20 module-related questions per day.
            * Dont slack off still going through review of old questions.
              Otherwise, they pile up!
         * A few times a month, Ill spend half the day focused on some old
           topic and slowly chip away.  As you go, make notes on what youre
           learning.  Switch over to view the topic to get more context
           (keyboard shortcut: t).  If something is completely unfamiliar,
           take a few moments to learn one or two things before moving on (and
           rating as 1).
         * All of the above actually subverts the normal algorithm, so
           eventually (once youve whittled down the big pile) you should
           settle into doing whatever FC decides you to do for that day.
      * After a week or so, youll start going through questions faster: youre
        learning!  Youll also get some positive reinforcement from seeing the
        graphs on the Insights page (https://med.firecracker.me/dashboard)
      * Theres a lot of upfront work of slogging through questions before you
        start to reach steady state maintenance mode.  As long as youre
        flagging new topics a few times a week (as youre going through new
        material), itll be a battle to keep that number down.
      * You need to spend time on weekends and vacations chipping away at
        questions, or they pile up.



# Question Banks


### [First Aid USMLE Step Question book](http://www.amazon.com/First-USMLE-Step-Third-Edition/dp/0071744029)

Consider buying a paper-based question bank because sometimes it's nice to
study without your computer or outside on a sunny day.


### [U World](http://www.usmleworld.com/purchase.aspx).

* $250 for qbank and self-assessment
* Purchase about 90 days out from your STEP1 date
* Organize your classmates to get a group discount

### [USMLE-Rx Qmax](https://www.usmle-rx.com/content/step-1-qmax)

   * 2524 total questions
   * 12mo subscription is $149 with $50 discount after free AMSA membership (regularly $199)
      * http://www.amsa.org/AMSA/Homepage/MemberCenter/JoinAMSA.aspx
      * https://www.usmle-rx.com/amsa
   * by the authors of First Aid, follows very closely
   * Strategy
      * Dont simply repeat questions you got wrong.  Instead, repeat questions that you thought were valuable (taught you something, had excellent explanations, drew a sharp contrast).  To do this, mark these valuable questions and later create a test of marked questions.

### [Kaplan](http://www.kaptest.com/Medical-Licensing/Step1/s1-qbank.html)

* 2006 total questions
* $210 with AMA membership ($20) for a total of $230
   * regularly $300 without AMA membership)

### Comparing Kaplan and Rx

* Kaplan has a terrible interface (Flash) and even worse iOS app
* Rx has an excellent, smooth web interface (HTML)
* hard to say which is better
* Kaplan has very thorough (better) explanations, but often too detailed
* Rx ties directly into FA (the explanations literally show you the relevant FA pages)


# Pathology

### [Pathoma](https://www.pathoma.com)

* $99 for 12 month, video + slim review text
* highly, highly recommend (Youll also see it highly recommended in FA Step 1
  resource recommendations appendix)
* 12 month subscription, so purchase 12 months out from exam (and use to
  review before exam), or purchase during Prologue 1 and then rely on the
  textbook during final month before exam -- either is okay, I did the former
* about 1.5 - 2.5 hours of video per module
* [record the audio][record audio]

[record audio]: http://www.wikihow.com/Record-Application-Audio-With-Soundflower

* Picmonic (http://picmonic.com)
   * $250 for 12 months, or $25/month
   * I use this only for spot treatment of various drugs and diseases that often times just require brute memorization (eg. vasculitides) rather than conceptual material (eg. pathophysiology of systems)
   * Whenever I hit something in Firecracker/etc that I have trouble recalling, I skim the picture in Picmonic.
   * I only use the Learn feature (not the Explore or other)
   * Im thinking Sketchy Micro is better

* Sketchy Micro http://sketchymicro.com/
   * video memory scenes of 47 bacteria
   * create free account to get: S aureus, S epidermidis, S saprophyticus, S
     pyogenes, S agalactiae, S pneumoniae, Strep viridans, Enterococcus
     * examples: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1BRRTxAdlQCy2Tq8YfHX0w
   * $40/6mo
   * Focused only on bacteria
   * Compared to Picmonic:
      * only bacteria (Picmonic: bacteria + viral + diseases + drugs + pathophys + more)
      * more cohesive scenes, less ridiculousness
      * for me, watching the scene getting drawn is more captivating (Picmonic: static scene)
      * cheaper ($7/mo versus $25/mo for Picmonic)
   * [record the audio][record audio]

* Edward Goljan audio (google for it)
   * A series of lectures recorded at an AMA conference years ago
   * full of board pearls since he helps edit the USMLE questions
   * these are suboptimal since we dont have the slides hes referring to
   * There are errors and it's not well organized, but makes for good
     background listening while running errands or doing chores.
   * Pathoma is probably a better use of time
   * I only used this for pulm and it was a disorganized experience, never
     again

* http://ankisrs.net/ - good but you have to spend time populating versus
  Firecracker is prepopulated
   * good for hot spot memorization of tables/charts (eg. drugs) but not
     recommended for general use since pre-populated resources exist
   * Consider focused decks:
      * First Aid Rapid Review -- several options:
        https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/3641619405,
        https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1656465381,
        https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2445310057
      * memorizing tables: vitamins and their names, eg. B3 niacin
   * note bene: everyone I know who used this eventually abandoned because of
     time involved in creating and curating decks
   * lacks good methods for sharing/updating decks with classmates

* KissPharm http://www.kisspharmacology.com/
   * no personal experience, recommended by an upperclassman

* Memorang App www.memorangapp.com
   * looks super simple

* Purchase schedule: Emory takes STEP 1 before 1 Feb (typically last half of Jan)
   * Feb - purchase your 1 year subscriptions:
      * Pathoma (definite)
      * Rx/Kaplan (either/both)
   * Firecracker can be purchased anytime, the sooner the better, so aim for 12 months (Feb) or 18 months (August).
   * after Summation when in final exam prep (Nov): U World (3 months)



# Anatomy

* Buy the recommended Clemente dissector and Netter atlas, same edition recommended. This way you match the lecture slide references.
   * As a table, buy two dissectors and two atlases to leave in the lab.
   * Personally buy Netter for home study (keep it for life).
   * Consider buying second copy of dissector for personal prep (not a gooey lab copy)
* Atlas of Anatomy 2e is good, but Netter is the gold standard and using Netter means that you'll be familiar with all the classic diagrams (e.g. cranial nerve plexus)
* Only buy 2 dissecting kits for your entire table and share. Make sure you have two of everything: scalpel, small & large scissors, small & large hemostats, small & large toothed & non-toothed tweezers (pickups).
* Consider buying your own fresh lab coat instead of using the stained used ones. Write your name prominently on the collar or front. Personalize as inspired.
* Buy thick multi-colored friendship bracelet string to tag arteries/veins/nerves/muscle/etc. (regular sewing thread is too thin and youll want multiple colors).  Keep it in a ziplock bag.
