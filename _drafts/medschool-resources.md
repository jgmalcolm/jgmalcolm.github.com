There are a hundreds resources available to help you study, and new ones pop
up every year.  I'm not going to even try to catalog them all.  This is a
short list of the resources I used during the didactic portion of med school.
I've experimented with various channels for learning: review texts, memory
palaces, video tutorials, spaced repetition software, physical note cards, and
more.


## [First Aid for STEP1](http://www.amazon.com/First-USMLE-Step-2014-Series/dp/0071831428)

* Everything you need to know to pass STEP1.  Not a good primary learning
  tool, but an excellent review
* Often referred to simply as First Aid or FA
* Every med student will purchase a copy of this.  New editions come out
  before Christmas.  This is the book you will likely spend the most time with
  in the months leading up to STEP1.
  * Consolidate resources: annotate

## [First Aid Basic Sciences](http://www.amazon.com/First-Basic-Sciences-VALUE-USMLE/dp/0071785744)

* A companion to First Aid for STEP1, but this is a learning tool.
* Covers all basic science in First Aid
* You could probably get buy purchasing this instead of the random specialized
  and overly-detailed books that professors recommend.


## Videos

* YouTube channels
* [Handwritten Tutorials](//handwrittentutorials.com)
  ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/harpinmartin)).
* Khan Academy: [biology], [cells], [cellular respiration], [immunology], [human biology], [physiology], and more

[cells]:                https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/cells
[biology]:              https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology
[cellular respiration]: https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/cellular-respiration
[immunology]:           https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/immunology
[human biology]:        https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/human-biology
[physiology]:           https://www.khanacademy.org/science/health-and-medicine




## [Pathoma](https://www.pathoma.com)

* Concise videos covering all relevant pathology
* $99 for 12 month, video + slim review text
* Highly, highly recommend (you'll also see it highly recommended in FA Step 1
  resource recommendations appendix)
* 12 month subscription, so purchase 12 months out from exam (and use to
  review before exam)
* About 1.5 - 2.5 hours of video per organ system
* [Record audio] so you can listen while you commute or exercise

Also for pathology, I used:

* [BRS Pathology]
  * Concise and well-organized review
  * Simpler than Pathoma
  * Each chapter has about 20 solid questions
* Goljan's [Rapid Review Pathology]
  * The same topic sequence as Pathoma but much more detail, especially when
    it comes to microbiology, but not as much as [Robbins & Cotran] (aka "The
    Bible of Pathology", get this if you're interested in Pathology as a
    residency).
  * Further on in the curriculum, I realized I wanted more details on
    pathology so I started skimming chapters from this.  Pathoma is sufficient
    for a good foundation.

If you had to rank order the complexity of these resources: BRS < Pathoma <
Goljan's < Robbins & Cotran.

[BRS Pathology]: http://www.amazon.com/dp/1451115873
[BRS Physiology]: http://www.amazon.com/dp/0781798760





  [spaced repetition]: http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition

## [Firecracker](https://firecracker.me)

* [Spaced repetition][spaced repetition] software
* Prepopulated with STEP1 material (a combination of First Aid, Goljan, etc.)
* As you cover material (daily/weekly) you add it to the question pool
  (flag it)
* Use the keyboard shortcuts (when you're doing a quiz, there's a little laptop
  icon on the bottom right)
  * S to show answer
  * T to show topic
  * 1..5 to rate cards
  * N/P for next/previous
  * Enter to save your rating and move on
* The "practice simulations" are very low quality; stick to Rx/Kaplan/UWorld



### How I use Firecracker


Sometimes I fall behind and the question load can be overwhelming.  Here are
your options:

* **Bang through the questions.** There's no substitute to just putting in the
  time.  Glancing at the info and rating it a 1 is better than ignoring it
  forever.  Try to just remember one bit of info and then move on.
* **Do Fewer questions** and focus on a few topics.  Otherwise, you might feel
  like you're getting punched from every direction as random topics hit you.
  * Above the calendar, click "More Options" > "Do Fewer Questions".
* **Spread out questions** over the coming days/weeks.
  * You can only spread Review and Catchup questions (not Study).
  * Above the calendar, click "More Options" > "Spread Out Questions".
* **Switch to Normal Mode** to focus on a smaller set of the highest yield
  material.
  * Normal mode contains about half the number of questions.
  * You still get the benefit of reviewing topics according to how strong you
    are, and you can always take a moment to review the full topic and all its
    sub-topic details that you might have been tested on in Legendary Mode.
  * To switch learning modes, click the doctor icon in the top-right >
    "Account & Settings" > "Settings" > "Normal Mode" (default is "Legendary")
  * Your flagged topics, notes, and history will all remain.
  * In the months **leading up to STEP1, I switched to Normal mode** so I
    could hit the high points but start spending more time with Qbanks and
    other resources.


## Ratings  1-5 ratings

* For information you've never seen, mark as Forgot (1)
   * Pause and just skim the information because you need to learn this
     stuff anyway.  Try to learn one little piece from that question.  For
     now breeze through it.
   * You will come back to these questions in the months before STEP
   * If you skip, you'll just accumulate cards.
* they're a self assessment, and you'll soon get comfortable with what they
  mean to you.  Here's my thinking:
   * never seen, completely forgot, messed it up royal, want to see
     tomorrow 1
      * if you missed an important part of the answer and want to retest
        tomorrow
   * got most of it, some recall, want to see it in 2-3 days 2
      * if you missed an important part of the answer and think you can
        wait a few days to retest
   * got most of it, reasoned guess was correct, want to see it in 4-5
     days 3
   * got all but one or two details, see it in a week 4
   * knew it perfectly, minor detail missed that you don't think is
     important 5
   * In general: I use 1,2 a lot while I'm learning.  3 if something is
     shaky.  Using 4-5 will quickly push things out too far into the
     horizon. I only use 5 if I have something down and I want to push
     it out on the order of weeks.

* If you're coming to the party late (a few months/year into medical school),
  then you'll have a lot of catching up to do.  You'll want to eventually have
  most everything flagged that you've touched on in school.  It'll be an
  overwhelming number of questions and there's no excuse but to put in time
  slogging through so the algorithm calibrates what you know and what you
  don't know.  Just put in the time.  There's no substitute.
   * On the [Study Plan dashboard](https://med.firecracker.me/study_plan),
     under "Do Questions" choose
     [More Options](https://med.firecracker.me/quiz/advanced) > "Do Fewer
     Questions" > "Uncheck everything".  Then select a topic like Cardiology
     to focus your questions.
   * While I'm in a module, I find the algorithm doesnt feed me enough
     questions daily (it is focused on long term and not backward planning
     from your module exam), so I'll go "Do More Questions" > "<Module>" >
     "All Days" and get a few hundred questions to pound through.
      * You need to have everything flagged (ie. first pass in studying)
        by about into the module, that way the algorithm spends the last
        of your module focusing in on what you dont know in that whole
        big pile.
      * The last week of a module should all be daily maintenance of FC
        questions and full qbank assault.  During exam week, FC may only
        be feeding you 10-20 module-related questions per day.
      * Dont slack off still going through review of old questions.
        Otherwise, they pile up!
   * A few times a month, I'll spend half the day focused on some old topic
     and slowly chip away.  As you go, make notes on what youre learning.
     Switch over to view the topic to get more context (keyboard shortcut: t).
     If something is completely unfamiliar, take a few moments to learn one or
     two things before moving on (and rating as 1).
   * All of the above actually subverts the normal algorithm, so
     eventually (once youve whittled down the big pile) you should
     settle into doing whatever FC decides you to do for that day.
* After a week or so, you'll start going through questions faster: youre
  learning!  You'll also get some positive reinforcement from seeing the
  graphs on the Insights page (https://med.firecracker.me/dashboard)
* Theres a lot of upfront work of slogging through questions before you
  start to reach steady state maintenance mode.  As long as youre
  flagging new topics a few times a week (as youre going through new
  material), itll be a battle to keep that number down.
* You need to spend time on weekends and vacations chipping away at
  questions, or they pile up.



## [Anki](http://ankisrs.net)

* Good but you have to spend time populating versus Firecracker which is
  prepopulated
* Good for hot spot memorization of tables/charts (eg. drugs, cytokines,
  vitamins) but not recommended for general use since pre-populated resources
  exist
* Some prepopulated [decks](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/3641619405)
  [already](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1656465381)
  [exist](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2445310057) for the "Rapid Review"
  tables in First Aid
* Lacks good methods for sharing/updating decks with classmates
* Better graphs than Firecracker to chart progress
* Note bene: Everyone I know who used this eventually abandoned because of
  time involved in creating and curating decks




# Question Banks


## [U World](http://www.usmleworld.com/purchase.aspx).

* $250 for qbank and self-assessment
* Created by the authors of the STEP1 exam
  * Just like the First Aid for STEP1 review book, everyone purchases U World.
* Purchase about 90 days out from your STEP1 date
* Organize your classmates to get a group discount


## [USMLE-Rx Qmax](https://www.usmle-rx.com/content/step-1-qmax)

* 2524 total questions
* 12mo subscription is $149 with $50 discount after free AMSA membership
  (regularly $199)
   * http://www.amsa.org/AMSA/Homepage/MemberCenter/JoinAMSA.aspx
   * https://www.usmle-rx.com/amsa
* by the authors of First Aid, follows very closely
* Strategy
   * Dont simply repeat questions you got wrong.  Instead, repeat questions
     that you thought were valuable (taught you something, had excellent
     explanations, drew a sharp contrast).  To do this, mark these valuable
     questions and later create a test of marked questions.

## [Kaplan](http://www.kaptest.com/Medical-Licensing/Step1/s1-qbank.html)

* 2006 total questions
* $210 with AMA membership ($20) for a total of $230
   * regularly $300 without AMA membership)

### Comparing Kaplan and USMLE-Rx

* It's hard to say which is better
  * Kaplan has very thorough (better) explanations, but often too detailed.
    That said, if you get good at Kaplan, you'll probably know the material
    nuances better than with Rx.
  * Rx ties directly into FA (the explanations literally show you the relevant
    FA pages).  Use it as a way to learn FA and then move on to UWorld.
* User interface: Rx is a clear winner
  * Rx has an excellent, smooth web interface (HTML), poor iOS app
  * Kaplan has a terrible interface (Flash) and even worse iOS app


## [First Aid USMLE Step Question book](http://www.amazon.com/First-USMLE-Step-Third-Edition/dp/0071744029)

* Consider buying a paper-based question bank because sometimes it's nice to
  study without your computer or outside on a sunny day.
* I've found only a couple of questions duplicated in USMLE-Rx Qmax
* I sometimes use these as throwaway [pretest questions][pretesting] early on
  in a module to "prime" my brain for key concepts to be on the lookout for.

## [Picmonic](http://picmonic.com)

* static [memory scenes] with audio guide
* $250 for 12 months, or $25/month
* I use this only for spot treatment of various drugs and diseases that often
  times just require brute memorization (eg. pharm, vasculitides) rather than
  conceptual material (eg. pathophysiology of systems)
* Whenever I hit something I have trouble recalling, I skim the picture in
  Picmonic or queue it up in a review play list.
* I only use the Learn feature (not the Explore or other)
* [record the audio][record audio]


## [Sketchy Micro](http://sketchymicro.com)

* video [memory scenes] of 47 bacteria
* create free account to get: S aureus, S epidermidis, S saprophyticus, S
  pyogenes, S agalactiae, S pneumoniae, Strep viridans, Enterococcus, and
  [free samples on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1BRRTxAdlQCy2Tq8YfHX0w)
* $40/6mo
* Focused only on bacteria
* Compared to Picmonic:
   * Overall higher quality and better explanations
   * only bacteria (Picmonic: bacteria + viral + diseases + drugs + pathophys + more)
   * more intuitive scenes (Picmonic can be ridiculous and make no sense)
   * for me, watching the scene getting drawn is more captivating (Picmonic: static scene)
   * cheaper ($7/mo versus $25/mo for Picmonic)
   * simple but poor navigation vs Picmonic which is overly complicated and
     buggy in a lot of cases
* [record the audio][record audio]

[memory scenes]: http://www.ted.com/talks/joshua_foer_feats_of_memory_anyone_can_do

## Goljan audio

* A series of lectures as part of a review course he conducted.
* These lectures were delivered with the first edition of
  [Rapid Review Pathology] text, but you can still follow along in the latest
  edition.  The slides and a scan of the original textbook can be found
  online.
* Full of board pearls since he helps edit the USMLE questions.  While most of
  the pathognomonic stuff is outdated, the concepts are still valid.
* There are minor errors and it's not well organized, but makes for good
  background listening while running errands or doing chores.
* Pathoma is probably a better use of time



# Misc Resources Not Evaluated

* [KissPharm](http://www.kisspharmacology.com) - no personal experience,
  recommended by an upperclassman
* [Memorang App](www.memorangapp.com)- looks super simple




# Anatomy

* [Netter](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1455704180) is the gold standard and has
  all the classic diagrams you'll see in lectures, eg. cervical plexus.
  [Atlas of Anatomy 2e](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1604067454) is also great,
  but probably best to stick with Netter.
* Buy the recommended Clemente dissector and Netter atlas, same edition
  recommended. This way you match the lecture slide references.
   * As a table, buy two dissectors and two atlases to leave in the lab.
   * Personally buy Netter for home study (keep it for life).
   * Consider getting a second copy of the dissector for personal prep (not a
     gooey lab copy)
* Only buy two (2) dissecting kits for your entire table and share. Make sure
  you have two of everything: scalpel, small & large scissors, small & large
  hemostats, small & large toothed & non-toothed tweezers (pickups).
* Consider buying your own fresh lab coat instead of using the stained used
  ones. Write your name prominently on the collar or front. Personalize as
  inspired.
* Buy thick multi-colored friendship bracelet string to tag arteries, veins,
  nerves, muscle, etc. Regular sewing thread is too thin and you'll want
  multiple colors.  Keep it in a ziplock bag.

# Recording audio from video

  [record audio]: #recording-audio-from-video

For Pathoma and SketchyMicro, I recorded the audio to mp3 so that I could
listen to it while commuting or exercising.  While lacking the visual learning
experience it's a way to eek out a little extra learning, but keep in mind
that it's not as engaging or valuable as watching the videos to pick up the
mental imagery.

* Install [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net) to record and export audio
* Install [Soundflower](https://code.google.com/p/soundflower/downloads/list)
  to channel audio from your browser to Audacity

* Record settings
  * [Screenshots showing the process][wikihow]
  * Audacity
    * Set the microphone to Soundflower (2ch), Mono
  * Enable 'Sound activated recording' so you won't have to start/stop/trim;
    it'll just start when the video starts, and stop when the video stops.
    * Audacity: Preferences > Recording > enable 'Sound activated recording'
* MP3 export settings
  * How I name MP3s from each service (ID3 info): Artist / Album / Track
    * Pathoma / chapter / topic
    * SketchyMicro / bug group / bug
    * Picmonic / organ system play list / vignette
  * Encoding settings
    * Install either LAME or FFmpeg
    * 22 KHz sampling, (fast) variable 65-105 kbps, mono
