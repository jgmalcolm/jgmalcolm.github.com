## Class or No-Class

* hard to learn from review books
* lectures can give unnecessary details, especially when lecturers venture
  into their own research projects.  Interesting to be aware of but don't
  spend energy memorizing.

* Do not subscribe to the class transcript service. If anything, only do the LOs. For Human Disease, consider dropping entirely. During Human Disease, use vetted third party standard study guides.
   * Simply reading the slides yourself is enough. You should be spending most of your time with the vetted, edited authority texts; not Emory material.
   * Add up all the money you will save not subscribing to each module. Use that to buy Kaplan, Firecracker, Pathoma, etc
* read the study guide booklet produced by SOM, unless you were a bio major you will entirely change the manner in which you studied in college
   * review each lecture within 48hrs
      * lecture is a poor primary learning experience, you should already have learned the material ahead of lecture and while in lecture you should be seeing how things fit together and soaking in the lecturers commentary
   * active studying: create a study guide (written > typed)  (not passive reading)
      * if you write, judge your productivity the end of the day by how many sheets of paper you produced
   * aim for about 1:1 ratio of hour of lecture to hour of study
   * dont spend all your time (passively) reading texts/slides  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_effect
* at the end of every MCQ test, before you submit, write down 3 things youre going to immediately lookup that afternoon.  Go study those three things.
* review your test  notice what type of mistakes you make (see SOM study booklet), note items that are repeated -- youll see them again
   * write down 3-5 things youre going to immediately look up

* If something is covered in lecture that has little or no FA coverage, then dont spend much time on it.  Look for one or two testable nuggets and just passively listen to rest of lecture.  Yes, this may be on exam, but if so then itll likely be a very clear question.  Professors will know stuff is not part of STEP and so tend to make these lectures very simple straight recall type questions.

* Slides are enough to study from to pass, but not enough to be at the top
   * only refer to TR/audio (or LO) if you need explanation
   * TR/audio tells you important/key
   * classmate LOs can be too detailed or wordy but are good reviews
   * if something on a slide is in different font/color then very important, >50% chance it will be on exam
   * You should study first from EUSOM material (so you know what topics are covered), then First Aid (to reinforce whats important for STEP), then other 3rd party (to get different/better explanations).  Many students get caught up in 3rd party materials and forget to cover Emory-specific material that shows up on this specific module exam, but wasnt covered in 3rd party simply because its covered in other chapters of 3rd party materials (ie. would show up on later modules).
   * Conversely, only using external resources (FA, Pathoma, the module-recommended text) will only get you 80-90% of the material for Emorys MCQs and SA.  Every module will have lectures and questions that arent even mentioned in the standard external resources.

* First Aid USMLE Step Question book (MCQs)
   * http://www.amazon.com/First-USMLE-Step-Third-Edition/dp/0071744029
   * Human Disease: get a current copy and markup each section of questions as you proceed

* do the Qbank questions with First Aid open and annotate
   * look up whatever you dont know
   * dont add much extra information to FA, only annotate clarifying information
   * In the margin of your FA, put a dot next to material when you hit a question related to it.  Over time, you'll see what sections are high yield and which are not
   * after each question, look at the answer and explanation -- do this as you go so you get immediate feedback
   * Its important to drive through QBanks efficiently.  Toward that end  Print out the questions and mark it up; its easier than futzing with questions on your laptop and lets you push aside your computer to focus.  The second time you see a particular concept you dont know, pause to research it before answering and continuing; its a waste to guess repeatedly.  Repeated concepts are important, so good to stop while its fresh.  But come back quick; dont get distracted.
   * David Young: "More than anything, anki/FC help us avoid the number one error people make when studying: reading something you dont know but believing you really do. The open ended questions in FC will see if you really do remember the 11 criteria for SLE or the findings for beta thalassemia minor, whereas you may review that topic in FA and feel like you know it simply because the words are familiar. People who on exams consistently feel like all the questions are familiar and they know the answer but just cant think of it are probably falling into this category. This alone is probably what separates the all-honors students from the all-pass students. The ability to generate the answers on your own rather than recognize them with deja vu is critical, and FC takes aim at this directly."

* First Aid: http://www.amazon.com/First-USMLE-Step-2014-Series/dp/0071831428 (referred to as First Aid or FA) and http://www.amazon.com/First-Basic-Sciences-VALUE-USMLE/dp/0071785744
   * at start of school, purchase Basic Sciences
   * through Healthy Human, use a current FA
   * purchase new FA when it comes out (December), use that until Step 1
      * give your old copy to an underclassman
   * Consolidate resources: don't buy every book out there, experiment some to
     find what works for you, but ultimately settle on a few resources and
     know them thoroughly.  It's easy to be fooled into thinking buying a
     resource will improve your score; only time spent learning will improve
     your score.  (thank Jason Boulter)


* U World (http://www.usmleworld.com/purchase.aspx)
   * 90 days out - $250 for qbank and self-assessment  ~1 Nov
   * organize with classmates to purchase a group package

* https://firecracker.me - like Anki but pre-populated with First Aid material
   * read up on Spaced Repetition: http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition
   * purchase either:
      * 18 months at start of school  ($375)
      * 12 months during Prologue 1, extend 1-2 months if you need when the time comes
   * If youre overwhelmed in starting out, consider using Normal mode (in settings) to limit it to key topics.  Youll want to move to Legendary at some point, but this might make it a little less daunting to start.
   * For information youve never seen, mark as Forgot (1)
      * Pause and just skim the information because you need to learn this stuff anyway.  Try to learn one little piece from that question.  For now breeze through it.
      * You will come back to these questions in the months before STEP
      * If you skip, youll just accumulate cards.
   * use the keyboard shortcuts (when youre doing a quiz, theres a little laptop icon on the bottom right)
   * as you cover material (daily/weekly) you add it to the question pool (flag it)
   * this does include NBME-style questions but they are not as high quality as Kaplan, USMLE-Rx, and UWorld
   * How I use Firecracker
      * 1-5 ratings - theyre a self assessment, and youll soon get comfortable with what they mean to you.  Heres my thinking:
         * never seen, completely forgot, messed it up royal, want to see tomorrow  1
            * if you missed an important part of the answer and want to retest tomorrow
         * got most of it, some recall, want to see it in 2-3 days  2
            * if you missed an important part of the answer and think you can wait a few days to retest
         * got most of it, reasoned guess was correct, want to see it in 4-5 days  3
         * got all but one or two details, see it in a week  4
         * knew it perfectly, minor detail missed that you dont think is important  5
         * In general: I use 1,2 a lot while Im learning.  3 if something is shakey.  Using 4-5 will quickly push things out too far into the horizon. I only use 5 if I have something down and I want to push it out on the order of weeks.
      * If youre coming to the party late (a few months/year into medical school), then youll have a lot of catching up to do.  Youll want to eventually have everything flagged that youve touched on in school.  Itll be an overwhelming number of questions and theres no excuse but to put in time slogging through so the algorithm calibrates what you know and what you dont know.  Just put in the time.  Theres no substitute.
         * On the Study Plan dashboard (https://med.firecracker.me/study_plan), under Do Questions choose More Options (https://med.firecracker.me/quiz/advanced) Do Fewer Questions  uncheck everything  select a topic like Pulmonology to focus your questions.
         * While Im in a module, I find the algorithm doesnt feed me enough questions daily (it is focused on long term and not backward planning from your module exam), so Ill go Do More Questions  <Module>  All Days and get a few hundred questions to pound through.
            * You need to have everything flagged (ie. first pass in studying) by about  into the module, that way the algorithm spends the last  of your module focusing in on what you dont know in that whole big pile.
            * The last week of a module should all be daily maintenance of FC questions and full qbank assault.  During exam week, FC may only be feeding you 10-20 module-related questions per day.
            * Dont slack off still going through review of old questions.  Otherwise, they pile up!
         * A few times a month, Ill spend half the day focused on some old topic and slowly chip away.  As you go, make notes on what youre learning.  Switch over to view the topic to get more context (keyboard shortcut: t).  If something is completely unfamiliar, take a few moments to learn one or two things before moving on (and rating as 1).
         * All of the above actually subverts the normal algorithm, so eventually (once youve whittled down the big pile) you should settle into doing whatever FC decides you to do for that day.
      * After a week or so, youll start going through questions faster: youre learning!  Youll also get some positive reinforcement from seeing the graphs on the Insights page (https://med.firecracker.me/dashboard)
      * Theres a lot of upfront work of slogging through questions before you start to reach steady state maintenance mode.  As long as youre flagging new topics a few times a week (as youre going through new material), itll be a battle to keep that number down.
      * You need to spend time on weekends and vacations chipping away at questions, or they pile up.

* USMLE-Rx https://www.usmle-rx.com/content/step-1-qmax
   * 2524 total questions
   * 12mo subscription is $149 with $50 discount after free AMSA membership (regularly $199)
      * http://www.amsa.org/AMSA/Homepage/MemberCenter/JoinAMSA.aspx
      * https://www.usmle-rx.com/amsa
   * by the authors of First Aid, follows very closely
   * Strategy
      * Dont simply repeat questions you got wrong.  Instead, repeat questions that you thought were valuable (taught you something, had excellent explanations, drew a sharp contrast).  To do this, mark these valuable questions and later create a test of marked questions.

* Kaplan http://www.kaptest.com/Medical-Licensing/Step1/s1-qbank.html
   * 2006 total questions
   * $210 with AMA membership ($20) for a total of $230
      * regularly $300 without AMA membership)

* Comparing Kaplan and Rx
   * Kaplan has a terrible interface (Flash) and even worse iOS app
   * Rx has an excellent, smooth web interface (HTML)
   * hard to say which is better
   * Kaplan has very thorough (better) explanations, but often too detailed
   * Rx ties directly into FA (the explanations literally show you the relevant FA pages)

* Pathoma (https://www.pathoma.com)
   * $99 for 12 month, video + slim review text
   * highly, highly recommend (Youll also see it highly recommended in FA Step 1 resource recommendations appendix)
   * 12 month subscription, so purchase 12 months out from exam (and use to review before exam), or purchase during Prologue 1 and then rely on the textbook during final month before exam -- either is okay, I did the former
   * about 1.5 - 2.5 hours of video per module
   * [record the audio][record audio]

[record audio]: http://www.wikihow.com/Record-Application-Audio-With-Soundflower

* Picmonic (http://picmonic.com)
   * $250 for 12 months, or $25/month
   * I use this only for spot treatment of various drugs and diseases that often times just require brute memorization (eg. vasculitides) rather than conceptual material (eg. pathophysiology of systems)
   * Whenever I hit something in Firecracker/etc that I have trouble recalling, I skim the picture in Picmonic.
   * I only use the Learn feature (not the Explore or other)
   * Im thinking Sketchy Micro is better

* Sketchy Micro http://sketchymicro.com/
   * video memory scenes of 47 bacteria
   * create free account to get: S aureus, S epidermidis, S saprophyticus, S
     pyogenes, S agalactiae, S pneumoniae, Strep viridans, Enterococcus
     * examples: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1BRRTxAdlQCy2Tq8YfHX0w
   * $40/6mo
   * Focused only on bacteria
   * Compared to Picmonic:
      * only bacteria (Picmonic: bacteria + viral + diseases + drugs + pathophys + more)
      * more cohesive scenes, less ridiculousness
      * for me, watching the scene getting drawn is more captivating (Picmonic: static scene)
      * cheaper ($7/mo versus $25/mo for Picmonic)
   * [record the audio][record audio]

* Edward Goljan audio (google for it)
   * A series of lectures recorded at an AMA conference years ago
   * full of board pearls since he helps edit the USMLE questions
   * these are suboptimal since we dont have the slides hes referring to
   * There are errors and it's not well organized, but makes for good
     background listening while running errands or doing chores.
   * Pathoma is probably a better use of time
   * I only used this for pulm and it was a disorganized experience, never
     again

* http://ankisrs.net/ - good but you have to spend time populating versus
  Firecracker is prepopulated
   * good for hot spot memorization of tables/charts (eg. drugs) but not
     recommended for general use since pre-populated resources exist
   * Consider focused decks:
      * First Aid Rapid Review -- several options:
        https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/3641619405,
        https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1656465381,
        https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2445310057
      * memorizing tables: vitamins and their names, eg. B3 niacin
   * note bene: everyone I know who used this eventually abandoned because of
     time involved in creating and curating decks
   * lacks good methods for sharing/updating decks with classmates

* KissPharm http://www.kisspharmacology.com/
   * no personal experience, recommended by an upperclassman

* Memorang App www.memorangapp.com
   * looks super simple

* Overall study routine recommended by Emory
   * preread to get a framework in mind before the lecture
   * ratio of 1:1 for hour of lecture to hour of review
   * active review  making your own study guide (not just reading passively)
      * within 48hrs of the lecture, dont fall behind
   * weekend: review the week, consolidate notes, qbanks

* Purchase schedule: Emory takes STEP 1 before 1 Feb (typically last half of Jan)
   * Feb - purchase your 1 year subscriptions:
      * Pathoma (definite)
      * Rx/Kaplan (either/both)
   * Firecracker can be purchased anytime, the sooner the better, so aim for 12 months (Feb) or 18 months (August).
   * after Summation when in final exam prep (Nov): U World (3 months)



## Anatomy

* Buy the recommended Clemente dissector and Netter atlas, same edition recommended. This way you match the lecture slide references.
   * As a table, buy two dissectors and two atlases to leave in the lab.
   * Personally buy Netter for home study (keep it for life).
   * Consider buying second copy of dissector for personal prep (not a gooey lab copy)
* Atlas of Anatomy 2e is good, but Netter is the gold standard and using Netter means that you'll be familiar with all the classic diagrams (e.g. cranial nerve plexus)
* Only buy 2 dissecting kits for your entire table and share. Make sure you have two of everything: scalpel, small & large scissors, small & large hemostats, small & large toothed & non-toothed tweezers (pickups).
* Consider buying your own fresh lab coat instead of using the stained used ones. Write your name prominently on the collar or front. Personalize as inspired.
* Buy thick multi-colored friendship bracelet string to tag arteries/veins/nerves/muscle/etc. (regular sewing thread is too thin and youll want multiple colors).  Keep it in a ziplock bag.

Studying
* Tables that contrast key features of disease
   * follicular adenoma (encapsulated) vs. follicular carcinoma (capsular breech)
   * 21-beta-hydroxylase (hypotensive) vs. 11-beta-hydroxylase (hypertensive)
   * Liddles Syndrome (hypokalemia) vs. Georges Syndrome (hyperkalemia)
   * Emphysema (PaCO2 and PaO2 are normal until later in the disease course) vs. chronic bronchitis (PaCO2 and PaO2 are abnormal earlier on)
   * Emphysema (cor pulmonale is low) vs. chronic bronchitis (cor pulmonale high)
   * Thalassemia (defective synthesis of globin) vs. Sickle Cell (defective structure of globin)
Test Taking
* rule out/in with buzz words: If a question prompt gives the classic/pathognomonic sign of some disease, then assume that is definitely present and work around that anchor point.
   * A 35-year-old woman presents with a recent weight gain of 20 lbs and new-onset depression. On physical examination she has a blood pressure of 135/82 mmHg, pulse of 76 beats per minute, and generalized obesity. She does not have facial plethora (i.e. she does not exactly have classic Cushing  think of things that are related, ie. pseudo-Cushing), and her proximal muscle strength is good. Laboratory data show 24-hour urine free cortisol excretion, 120 mcg (normal, 20 to 90 mcg). (from Endocrine Pathophysiology, p227)
* Beware of lab values just outside of normal.  It indicates the question is not a slam dunk diagnosis, and that there is some variation or mixed situation.  While to you the questions may often seem ambiguous, examiners try to create unambiguous questions so they dont get student complaints and quibbling.  Borderline lab values invite quibbling.  See above: if Cushings then would likely have higher cortisol.
* Go with less invasive diagnostic tests unless the question makes the diagnosis a slam dunk.
* If there is mention of a relative who has/died of a similar disorder, then think genetic disease, eg. autosomal dominant, instead of acquired.
* When a question asks What is the best or What is the most likely.., there will probably be more than one answer that is close, but then one will be the best in some measure.
* Look for contrasts to distinguish diseases.
   * Both pernicious anemia and B12 insufficiency have the same symptoms of lack of B12, but PA is caused by lack of intrinsic factor (autoimmune destruction) versus malabsorption of B12.

Performance during the first two years of medical school are still the most important predictor of success on Step 1. However, the effect of questions is still the only other resource that improves Step 1 score.

## Studying takes energy.

It's often obvious what needs to be done and how best to do it.  Sometimes all
that's really needed is the energy (and motivation) to carry through.  So part
of studying is managing your energy.

Switch tactics: if you're getting bored of answering questions, switch over to
watch a video lecture.
