What to study.  How to study it.  How to test.


# Content: What to study?

# Resources: How to study it?

# Question banks: How to apply the facts?



# Memorizing

## Spaced repetition

Spaced repetition provides the most efficient schedule for reviewing material,
but this schedule is separate from *how* you absorb the material.



# Practice questions



## Class or No-Class

* hard to learn from review books
* lectures can give unnecessary details, especially when lecturers venture
  into their own research projects.  Interesting to be aware of but don't
  spend energy memorizing.

   * Simply reading the slides yourself is enough. You should be spending most
     of your time with the vetted, edited authority texts; not Emory material.
   * Add up all the money you will save not subscribing to each module. Use
     that to buy Kaplan, Firecracker, Pathoma, etc

* at the end of every MCQ test, before you submit, write down 3 things you're
  going to immediately look up that afternoon.  Go study those three things.

* review your test notice what type of mistakes you make (see SOM study
  booklet), note items that are repeated -- you'll see them again
   * write down 3-5 things you're going to immediately look up

* If something is covered in lecture that has little or no FA coverage, then
  don't spend much time on it.  Look for one or two testable nuggets and just
  passively listen to rest of lecture.  Yes, this may be on exam, but if so
  then it'll likely be a very clear question.  Professors will know stuff is
  not part of STEP and so tend to make these lectures very simple straight
  recall type questions.

* Slides are enough to study from to pass, but not enough to be at the top
   * only refer to TR/audio (or LO) if you need explanation
   * TR/audio tells you important/key
   * classmate LOs can be too detailed or wordy but are good reviews
   * if something on a slide is in different font/color then very important,
     >50% chance it will be on exam
   * You should study first from EUSOM material (so you know what topics are
     covered), then First Aid (to reinforce whats important for STEP), then
     other 3rd party (to get different/better explanations).  Many students
     get caught up in 3rd party materials and forget to cover Emory-specific
     material that shows up on this specific module exam, but wasn't covered in
     3rd party simply because its covered in other chapters of 3rd party
     materials (ie. would show up on later modules).
   * Conversely, only using external resources (FA, Pathoma, the
     module-recommended text) will only get you 80-90% of the material for
     Emory's MCQs and SA.  Every module will have lectures and questions that
     aren't even mentioned in the standard external resources.

* do the Qbank questions with First Aid open and annotate
   * look up whatever you don't know
   * don't add much extra information to FA, only annotate clarifying
     information
   * In the margin of your FA, put a dot next to material when you hit a
     question related to it.  Over time, you'll see what sections are high
     yield and which are not
   * after each question, look at the answer and explanation -- do this as you
     go so you get immediate feedback
   * Its important to drive through QBanks efficiently.  Toward that end Print
     out the questions and mark it up; its easier than futzing with questions
     on your laptop and lets you push aside your computer to focus.  The
     second time you see a particular concept you don't know, pause to research
     it before answering and continuing; its a waste to guess repeatedly.
     Repeated concepts are important, so good to stop while its fresh.  But
     come back quick; don't get distracted.
   * David Young: "More than anything, Anki/FC help us avoid the number one
     error people make when studying: reading something you don't know but
     believing you really do. The open ended questions in FC will see if you
     really do remember the 11 criteria for SLE or the findings for beta
     thalassemia minor, whereas you may review that topic in FA and feel like
     you know it simply because the words are familiar. People who on exams
     consistently feel like all the questions are familiar and they know the
     answer but just cant think of it are probably falling into this
     category. This alone is probably what separates the all-honors students
     from the all-pass students. The ability to generate the answers on your
     own rather than recognize them with deja vu is critical, and FC takes aim
     at this directly." (from

## Studying

* Tables that contrast key features of disease
   * follicular adenoma (encapsulated) vs. follicular carcinoma (capsular
     breech)
   * 21-beta-hydroxylase (hypotensive) vs. 11-beta-hydroxylase (hypertensive)
   * Liddle's Syndrome (hypokalemia) vs. Georges Syndrome (hyperkalemia)
   * Emphysema (PaCO2 and PaO2 are normal until later in the disease course)
     vs. chronic bronchitis (PaCO2 and PaO2 are abnormal earlier on)
   * Emphysema (cor pulmonale is low) vs. chronic bronchitis (cor pulmonale
     high)
   * Thalassemia (defective synthesis of globin) vs. Sickle Cell (defective
     structure of globin) Test Taking
* rule out/in with buzz words: If a question prompt gives the
  classic/pathognomonic sign of some disease, then assume that is definitely
  present and work around that anchor point.
   * A 35-year-old woman presents with a recent weight gain of 20 lbs and
     new-onset depression. On physical examination she has a blood pressure of
     135/82 mmHg, pulse of 76 beats per minute, and generalized obesity. She
     does not have facial plethora (i.e. she does not exactly have classic
     Cushing think of things that are related, ie. pseudo-Cushing), and her
     proximal muscle strength is good. Laboratory data show 24-hour urine free
     cortisol excretion, 120 mcg (normal, 20 to 90 mcg). (from Endocrine
     Pathophysiology, p227)
* Beware of lab values just outside of normal.  It indicates the question is
  not a slam dunk diagnosis, and that there is some variation or mixed
  situation.  While to you the questions may often seem ambiguous, examiners
  try to create unambiguous questions so they don't get student complaints and
  quibbling.  Borderline lab values invite quibbling.  See above: if Cushing's
  then would likely have higher cortisol.
* Go with less invasive diagnostic tests unless the question makes the
  diagnosis a slam dunk.
* If there is mention of a relative who has/died of a similar disorder, then
  think genetic disease, eg. autosomal dominant, instead of acquired.
* When a question asks What is the best or What is the most likely.., there
  will probably be more than one answer that is close, but then one will be
  the best in some measure.
* Look for contrasts to distinguish diseases.
   * Both pernicious anemia and B12 insufficiency have the same symptoms of
     lack of B12, but PA is caused by lack of intrinsic factor (autoimmune
     destruction) versus malabsorption of B12.


## Organize information the way it gets tested

Tests typically present a clinical vignette with chief complaint and then some
secondary information to narrow down the diagnosis.

For example, consider a patient presenting with osteomyelitis.  With no clues,
*S aureus* is most likely overall, but the vignette will likely give some
history or physical exam findings that point to other causes.  You want to put
to put together a table like the following.

| Clue | Cause
|-
| none | *S aureus*
| Sexually active | septic arthritis, *Neisseria gonorrhea*
| Sickle cell | *Salmonella*
| Diabetic | *Pseudomonas*, *Serratia*
| Prosthetic joint | *S aureus* > *S epidermidis*
| Vertebral | *M tuberculosis* (Pott's disease)
| Cat/Dog bite | *Pasteurella*

| Fracture of humerus | Nerve | Function | Sensation
|-
| Surgical neck | axillary | abduction | lateral arm
| mid-shaft | radial (musculospiral groove) | wrist drop | dorsal
| lateral epicondyle | radial | wrist drop | dorsal
| medial epicondyle | ulnar | claw hand (radial dominance)


## Compare and contrast topics

Make your own tables.  Don't simply reply on those in your textbooks or First
Aid.  Work out your own versions that start out simpler and only list and
compare one or two of the most important features.

Some dimensions you can compare and contrast along:

- epidemiology
  - younger or older patients?
  - risk factors: sex, drugs, smoking
- onset
  - slow, insidious, progressive
  - acute, emergent
  - congenital, shortly after birth


## Studying takes energy.

It's often obvious what needs to be done and how best to do it.  Sometimes all
that's really needed is the energy (and motivation) to carry through.  So part
of studying is managing your energy.

It takes a long time to truly build up the discipline and tolerance to sustain
consistent long hours for days on end.  As you stretch yourself, you will do a
lot of studying when you really don't want to.  It's critical you figure out
ways to manage your energy and stretch your [willpower][willpower].

 [willpower]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143122231/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0143122231&linkCode=as2&tag=jgmalcolm-20&linkId=RUYFTLGPIX7E62OL

Your mind wandering while you're trying to study a diagram or memorize a
table?  Recopy it by hand multiple times.  It requires only determination to
keep copying while you're brain is (mostly) on autopilot.  I'm always amazed
at how effective this can be.  I usually pull this out when I've repeatedly
gotten a topic wrong, and I just channel that frustration into recopying a
diagram or table.  Each iteration, add a new detail to the diagram, simplify a
part you already know, go faster.

**Break the problem down into easier pieces.** Is the entire combined
glycolytic, TCA, Urea pathway too daunting?  Then just pick one to redraw for
now.  Work on another later.

  some details and not something I'd put on the refrigerator, but at least I
  now know the basic cascade.</figcaption>

**Switch tactics to boost energy.** If you're getting bored of answering
questions, switch over to watch a video lecture.

**Optimize your procrastination equation.** What's keeping you from doing what
you know you need to be doing?  Do you not think the pay off is worth it?  The
payoff is too far away?  The energy required is too much?  Whatever it is,
figure out a way to optimize that part of the
[procrastination equation][procrastination].

 [procrastination]: http://lesswrong.com/lw/9wr/my_algorithm_for_beating_procrastination/


## No figure or table is sacred

I often try to make things pretty.  Go fast and loose, and repeat frequently.


## Don't mistake activity for active learning

I often fall into the trap of writing everything down furiously so I can study
it later.  The truth is, you'll always be busy and never return to sort out
the material.  This is a form of autopilot, passive learning.  Always think
critically about information instead of just passively transcribing.


## How badly do you want it?

All the tactics in the world are not going to work if you don't have the
motivation to push forward.  Strong motivation energizes and fully engages
your senses.  Step back and think about what you want in a career and what
you're willing to trade for it.  Do you want that subspecialty residency so
much that you're willing to prioritize weekend study over social outings?

It's not just about a test score and getting into a top residency.  It's about
becoming the best physician possible.  It's about being able to answer patient
questions, explain to them what's happening to their bodies.  It's about being
able to notice a disease pattern that others might have missed.


## Personal traps

**Glossing over big words.** I have a tendency to gloss over big words which
leaves it all a blur.  For example, I might reading the sentence on PKU from
biochemistry: "Phenylketonuria is due to a decrease in phenylalanine
hydroxylase or decreased tetrahydrobiopterin cofactor".  I would wrongly
glossing over the unfamiliar words, so I end up reading something more like
"Phenyl--- is due to a decrease in phenyl--- --- or decreased --- cofactor".
It's no wonder that a lot of biochemistry was just a blur to me.  I now to
force myself to slow down and parse every syllable, and slowly those hard
words have become more natural.

**Doing what's easiest.** Passively reading and nodding along because it all
seems familiar and I believe I know the material.  The harder road is to
actively do questions that test recall.  If material looks familiar but you're
having trouble recalling details necessary to answer questions, then you can
probably blame passive review.  As a corollary, with so many topics to study,
I often found myself avoiding some daunting topic by distracting myself with
more interesting (easier) topics.  Thinking about the
[procrastination equation][procrastination] often helped me find a way out of
the situation.

**Punting down field.** Often when I was going through question banks, tired,
and hit a topic I didn't know, I would mark the question and just tell myself
I'd come back to study it later.  The truth: I never would come back.  Fix:
Study the material immediately while the emotion of a wrong answer is still
present and you've got the question context in mind.  If you're too tired to
study the explanations, then you're too tired to do questions.  Either pack it
in, take a break, or switch to something else like watching Pathoma videos,
but don't get in the habit of telling yourself you'll do it tomorrow.
Tomorrow is always a day away.

**Tunnel vision.** When a patient has presents with systems involving multiple
systems (renal, muscular, pulmonary), I tended to mistakenly jump at answer
choices that might explain one or two findings perfectly, but ultimately
didn't explain all the physical exam or lab findings.  Now I know my answer
choices needs to [account for every abnormal finding][abnormal-findings].
There are no wasted words in these vignettes.

**Going too fast.** The more [practice questions][qbanks] I did, the quicker I
would get, but I also got sloppy.  When I noticed myself not improving and
making stupid mistakes, I had to slow myself down.  Read.  Slower.

## To type or write?

Typing is fast.  Writing is slow, but it forces you to think critically about
what's important to record.

Typing lets you copy and paste previous notes.  Writing forces you to be
economical in what you choose to record.  Typing lets you copy and paste a
figure into your notes.  Writing forces you to recopy the figure from scratch.
Writing ultimately forces you to work with the information slowly and
deliberately, and hence you're more likely to remember.

Typing lulls you into a false security of being able to quickly search and
look up information.  Writing forces you to scan manually, and so you end up
reviewing more ancillary information while searching for what you really want.

I started out typing to record the deluge of information, but ultimately I
ended up writing so I'd exercise my memory every time I had to rewrite a fact.


## Scratch work

Draw diagrams and simple tables.  Don't transcribe everything; these notes
should be much simpler than your textbooks and review.  Only record 1-2 key
distinguishing facts.  Those key facts will jog your memory of additional
ancillary facts.

When you revisit a topic, try to reproduce (redraw) as much as you can from
memory.  Resist the urge to immediately flip back in your notes.  Every time
you stretch your recall, it strengthens those neurons.  Every time you redraw
a diagram, you'll get faster.  I was dumb as bricks when it came to metabolic
biochemistry.  Repeatedly redrawing metabolic pathways was the only way I
could get it through my thick skull.

Keep this all bound, in order (dated) in a notebook so you can flip back ("Oh,
I remember that from last week ... let me find that ...").  At the start of
each day's study session, skim your pages from yesterday or the day before.
Since these notes are all the things you got wrong or want to remember, this
is like a poor man's version of [spaced repetition][].

## QBanks

* If you're getting worn down with full blocks of 46 questions, do smaller
  blocks so you get more immediate feedback.  Similarly, if your worm down by
  low performance, smaller blocks might show an actual score improvement for
  some positive feedback to keep you motivated.


## STEP1

STEP1 will punish those who do not put in the time.  As a cumulative exam,
anything you failed to learn during your modules will show up here and cost
you points again.  If you didn't learn something the first time, now is your
last chance.

STEP1 is a test of endurance and discipline.  I'm not talking about test day.
I'm talking about endurance and discipline in the months leading up to test
day.  If you fail to work diligently during your dedicated period, you will be
punished.

STEP1 is also a very straight forward test for anyone willing to dedicate the
energy to working through question banks.  I would wager that simply
completing something like 6000 questions easily puts you in the 240s.  The
difference between the 240s and the 260s is where active studying and critical
self-assessment make the difference.



## When studying

- **Control your environment, or it will control you.** If there's something
  distracting, get rid of it.  If you are at a coffee shop distracted by
  someone nearby, move your table or move to a different area.  If you're
  attention keeps drifting to something outside the window, draw the shades or
  move locations.  If you keep getting the impulse to check the news,
  [block the website][focus].  Move to a high traffic location where fellow
  students can see over your shoulder that you're goofing off.  Erect whatever
  barriers are necessary to make studying the easy road.
- **Unload distractions.** If you realize you need to do laundry, don't.
  Instead, write that on a piece of paper for something to do during your
  upcoming break.  Anything that is on your mind that's not about studying,
  simply write it on this list to think about later.  The simple act of
  writing something down and pushing that aside helps me de-clutter my mind.
  When a distracting urge rises up, learn to say "No" to yourself.
- **Be disciplined about short breaks.** Many times my 15min break would
  easily stretch to 30, 45min.  Set a timer to kick you back in to gear when
  the time comes.
- **Use your breaks to re-energize.** While studying, make a list of what you
  are looking forward to doing during your next break.  Plan fun things to
  look forward to.  When I get really worn down and start dragging in my
  studies, one remedy I use it to plan something super fun for the next break
  or that evening.


  [focus]: {% post_url 2014-05-07-top-students %}#focus


## When Not Studying

- **Sleep.**  Decrease stress and let your brain process the info you've fed it.
- **Exercise.** Decrease stress, release energy.
