## Class or No-Class

* hard to learn from review books
* lectures can give unnecessary details, especially when lecturers venture
  into their own research projects.  Interesting to be aware of but don't
  spend energy memorizing.

* Do not subscribe to the class transcript service. If anything, only do the
  LOs. For Human Disease, consider dropping entirely. During Human Disease,
  use vetted third party standard study guides.
   * Simply reading the slides yourself is enough. You should be spending most
     of your time with the vetted, edited authority texts; not Emory material.
   * Add up all the money you will save not subscribing to each module. Use
     that to buy Kaplan, Firecracker, Pathoma, etc
* read the study guide booklet produced by SOM, unless you were a bio major
  you will entirely change the manner in which you studied in college
   * review each lecture within 48hrs
      * lecture is a poor primary learning experience, you should already have
        learned the material ahead of lecture and while in lecture you should
        be seeing how things fit together and soaking in the lecturers
        commentary
   * active studying: create a study guide (written > typed) (not passive
     reading)
      * if you write, judge your productivity the end of the day by how many
        sheets of paper you produced
   * aim for about 1:1 ratio of hour of lecture to hour of study
   * don't spend all your time (passively) reading texts/slides
     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_effect
* at the end of every MCQ test, before you submit, write down 3 things you're
  going to immediately look up that afternoon.  Go study those three things.
* review your test notice what type of mistakes you make (see SOM study
  booklet), note items that are repeated -- you'll see them again
   * write down 3-5 things you're going to immediately look up

* If something is covered in lecture that has little or no FA coverage, then
  don't spend much time on it.  Look for one or two testable nuggets and just
  passively listen to rest of lecture.  Yes, this may be on exam, but if so
  then it'll likely be a very clear question.  Professors will know stuff is
  not part of STEP and so tend to make these lectures very simple straight
  recall type questions.

* Slides are enough to study from to pass, but not enough to be at the top
   * only refer to TR/audio (or LO) if you need explanation
   * TR/audio tells you important/key
   * classmate LOs can be too detailed or wordy but are good reviews
   * if something on a slide is in different font/color then very important,
     >50% chance it will be on exam
   * You should study first from EUSOM material (so you know what topics are
     covered), then First Aid (to reinforce whats important for STEP), then
     other 3rd party (to get different/better explanations).  Many students
     get caught up in 3rd party materials and forget to cover Emory-specific
     material that shows up on this specific module exam, but wasn't covered in
     3rd party simply because its covered in other chapters of 3rd party
     materials (ie. would show up on later modules).
   * Conversely, only using external resources (FA, Pathoma, the
     module-recommended text) will only get you 80-90% of the material for
     Emory's MCQs and SA.  Every module will have lectures and questions that
     aren't even mentioned in the standard external resources.

* do the Qbank questions with First Aid open and annotate
   * look up whatever you don't know
   * don't add much extra information to FA, only annotate clarifying
     information
   * In the margin of your FA, put a dot next to material when you hit a
     question related to it.  Over time, you'll see what sections are high
     yield and which are not
   * after each question, look at the answer and explanation -- do this as you
     go so you get immediate feedback
   * Its important to drive through QBanks efficiently.  Toward that end Print
     out the questions and mark it up; its easier than futzing with questions
     on your laptop and lets you push aside your computer to focus.  The
     second time you see a particular concept you don't know, pause to research
     it before answering and continuing; its a waste to guess repeatedly.
     Repeated concepts are important, so good to stop while its fresh.  But
     come back quick; don't get distracted.
   * David Young: "More than anything, Anki/FC help us avoid the number one
     error people make when studying: reading something you don't know but
     believing you really do. The open ended questions in FC will see if you
     really do remember the 11 criteria for SLE or the findings for beta
     thalassemia minor, whereas you may review that topic in FA and feel like
     you know it simply because the words are familiar. People who on exams
     consistently feel like all the questions are familiar and they know the
     answer but just cant think of it are probably falling into this
     category. This alone is probably what separates the all-honors students
     from the all-pass students. The ability to generate the answers on your
     own rather than recognize them with deja vu is critical, and FC takes aim
     at this directly." (from

* First Aid: http://www.amazon.com/First-USMLE-Step-2014-Series/dp/0071831428
  (referred to as First Aid or FA) and
  http://www.amazon.com/First-Basic-Sciences-VALUE-USMLE/dp/0071785744
   * at start of school, purchase Basic Sciences
   * through Healthy Human, use a current FA
   * purchase new FA when it comes out (December), use that until Step 1
      * give your old copy to an underclassman
   * Consolidate resources: don't buy every book out there, experiment some to
     find what works for you, but ultimately settle on a few resources and
     know them thoroughly.  It's easy to be fooled into thinking buying a
     resource will improve your score; only time spent learning will improve
     your score.  (thank Jason Boulter)



* Overall study routine recommended by Emory
   * pre-read to get a framework in mind before the lecture
   * ratio of 1:1 for hour of lecture to hour of review
   * active review  making your own study guide (not just reading passively)
      * within 48hrs of the lecture, don't fall behind
   * weekend: review the week, consolidate notes, qbanks

* Purchase schedule: Emory takes STEP 1 before 1 Feb (typically last half of Jan)
   * Feb - purchase your 1 year subscriptions:
      * Pathoma (definite)
      * Rx/Kaplan (either/both)
   * Firecracker can be purchased anytime, the sooner the better, so aim for 12 months (Feb) or 18 months (August).
   * after Summation when in final exam prep (Nov): U World (3 months)




Studying
* Tables that contrast key features of disease
   * follicular adenoma (encapsulated) vs. follicular carcinoma (capsular
     breech)
   * 21-beta-hydroxylase (hypotensive) vs. 11-beta-hydroxylase (hypertensive)
   * Liddle's Syndrome (hypokalemia) vs. Georges Syndrome (hyperkalemia)
   * Emphysema (PaCO2 and PaO2 are normal until later in the disease course)
     vs. chronic bronchitis (PaCO2 and PaO2 are abnormal earlier on)
   * Emphysema (cor pulmonale is low) vs. chronic bronchitis (cor pulmonale
     high)
   * Thalassemia (defective synthesis of globin) vs. Sickle Cell (defective
structure of globin) Test Taking
* rule out/in with buzz words: If a question prompt gives the
  classic/pathognomonic sign of some disease, then assume that is definitely
  present and work around that anchor point.
   * A 35-year-old woman presents with a recent weight gain of 20 lbs and
     new-onset depression. On physical examination she has a blood pressure of
     135/82 mmHg, pulse of 76 beats per minute, and generalized obesity. She
     does not have facial plethora (i.e. she does not exactly have classic
     Cushing think of things that are related, ie. pseudo-Cushing), and her
     proximal muscle strength is good. Laboratory data show 24-hour urine free
     cortisol excretion, 120 mcg (normal, 20 to 90 mcg). (from Endocrine
     Pathophysiology, p227)
* Beware of lab values just outside of normal.  It indicates the question is
  not a slam dunk diagnosis, and that there is some variation or mixed
  situation.  While to you the questions may often seem ambiguous, examiners
  try to create unambiguous questions so they don't get student complaints and
  quibbling.  Borderline lab values invite quibbling.  See above: if Cushing's
  then would likely have higher cortisol.
* Go with less invasive diagnostic tests unless the question makes the
  diagnosis a slam dunk.
* If there is mention of a relative who has/died of a similar disorder, then
  think genetic disease, eg. autosomal dominant, instead of acquired.
* When a question asks What is the best or What is the most likely.., there
  will probably be more than one answer that is close, but then one will be
  the best in some measure.
* Look for contrasts to distinguish diseases.
   * Both pernicious anemia and B12 insufficiency have the same symptoms of
     lack of B12, but PA is caused by lack of intrinsic factor (autoimmune
     destruction) versus malabsorption of B12.

Performance during the first two years of medical school are still the most
important predictor of success on Step 1. However, the effect of questions is
still the only other resource that improves Step 1 score. There is a 1 point
increase for every 200 questions
answered. https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B60xzfF7HDAvcnhsZFk5a3E1Y1U


## Organize information the way it gets tested

Tests typically present a clinical vignette with chief complaint and then some
secondary information to narrow down the diagnosis.

For example, consider a patient presenting with osteomyelitis.  With no clues,
*S aureus* is most likely overall, but the vignette will likely give some
history or physical exam findings that point to other causes.  You want to put
to put together a table like the following.

| Clue | Cause
|-
| none | *S aureus*
| Sexually active | septic arthritis, *Neisseria gonorrhea*
| Sickle cell | *Salmonella*
| Diabetic | *Pseudomonas*, *Serratia*
| Prosthetic joint | *S aureus* > *S epidermidis*
| Vertebral | *M tuberculosis* (Pott's disease)
| Cat/Dog bite | *Pasteurella*

| Fracture of humerus | Nerve | Function | Sensation
|-
| Surgical neck | axillary | abduction | lateral arm
| mid-shaft | radial (musculospiral groove) | wrist drop | dorsal
| lateral epicondyle | radial | wrist drop | dorsal
| medial epicondyle | ulnar | claw hand (radial dominance)


## Compare and contrast topics

Make your own tables.  Don't simply reply on those in your textbooks or First
Aid.  Make your own versions that start out simpler and only list and compare
a few of the most important features.

Some dimensions you can compare and contrast along:

- epidemiology
  - younger or older patients?
  - risk factors: sex, drugs, smoking
- onset
  - slow, insidious, progressive
  - acute, emergent
  - congenital, shortly after birth

## First-order and second-order questions.

Presented with a clinical vignette, a first-order question would ask about the
diagnosis while a second-order question would assume you can figure out the
diagnosis and instead ask about the treatment (eg. drug mechanism of action or
side effect).



## Studying takes energy.

It's often obvious what needs to be done and how best to do it.  Sometimes all
that's really needed is the energy (and motivation) to carry through.  So part
of studying is managing your energy.

Your mind wandering while you're trying to study a diagram or memorize a
table?  Recopy it by hand multiple times.  It requires only determination to
keep copying while you're brain is (mostly) on autopilot.  I'm always amazed
at how effective this can be.  I usually pull this out when I've repeatedly
gotten a topic wrong, and I just channel that frustration into recopying a
diagram or table.  Each iteration, add a new detail to the diagram, simplify a
part you already know, go faster.

**Break the problem down into easier pieces.** Is the entire combined
glycolytic, TCA, Urea pathway too daunting?  Then just pick one to redraw for
now.  Work on another later.

  <figcaption>Just look at that chicken scratch diagram of the coagulation
  cascade.  Lacking some details and not something I'd put on the
  refrigerator, but at least I now know the basic cascade.</figcaption>

  </figure>
</div>

**Switch tactics to boost energy.** If you're getting bored of answering
questions, switch over to watch a video lecture.

**Optimize your procrastination equation.** What's keeping you from doing what
you know you need to be doing?  Do you not think the pay off is worth it?  The
payoff is too far away?  The energy required is too much?  Whatever it is,
figure out a way to optimize that part of the
[procrastination equation][procrastination].

## No figure or table is sacred

I often try to make things pretty.  Go fast and loose, and repeat frequently.


## Don't mistake activity for active learning

I often fall into the trap of writing everything down furiously so I can study
it later.  The truth is, you'll always be busy and never return to sort out
the material.  This is a form of autopilot, passive learning.  Always think
critically about information instead of just passively transcribing.


## How badly do you want it?

All the tactics in the world are not going to work if you don't have the
motivation to push forward.  Strong motivation energizes and fully engages
your senses.  Step back and think about what you want in a career and what
you're willing to trade for it.  Do you want that subspecialty residency so
much that you're willing to prioritize weekend study over social outings?


## Personal traps

**Glossing over big words.** I have a tendency to gloss over big words which
leaves it all a blur.  For example, I might reading the sentence on PKU from
biochemistry: "Phenylketonuria is due to a decrease in phenylalanine
hydroxylase or decreased tetrahydrobiopterin cofactor".  I would wrongly
glossing over the unfamiliar words, so I end up reading something more like
"Phenyl--- is due to a decrease in phenyl--- --- or decreased --- cofactor".
I ended up missing a lot of biochemistry this way.  I now to force myself to
slow down and parse every syllable, and slowly those hard words have become
more natural.

**Doing what's easiest.** Passively reading and nodding along because it all
seems familiar and I believe I know the material.  The harder road is to
actively do questions that test recall.  If material looks familiar but you're
having trouble recalling details necessary to answer questions, then you can
probably blame passive review.

**Punting down field.** Often when I was going through question banks, tired,
and hit a topic I didn't know, I would mark the question and just tell myself
I'd come back to study it later.  The truth: I never would come back.  Fix:
Study the material immediately while the emotion of a wrong answer is still
present and you've got the question context in mind.  If you're too tired to
study the explanations, then you're too tired to do questions.  Either pack it
in, take a break, or switch to something else like watching Pathoma videos.

**Tunnel vision.** When a patient has presents with systems involving multiple
systems (renal, muscular, pulmonary), I tended to mistakenly jump at answer
choices that might explain one or two findings perfectly, but ultimately
didn't explain all the physical exam or lab findings.  Now I know my answer
choices needs to [account for every abnormal finding][abnormal-findings].
There are no wasted words in these vignettes.

**Going too fast.** The more [practice questions][qbanks] I did, the quicker I
would get, but I also got sloppy.  When I noticed myself not improving and
making stupid mistakes, I had to slow myself down.

## To type or write?

Typing is fast.  Writing is slow, and so it forces you to think critically
about what's important to record.

Typing lets you copy and paste previous notes.  Writing forces you to be
economical in what you choose to record.  Typing lets you copy and paste a
figure into your notes.  Writing forces you to recopy the figure from scratch.
Writing ultimately forces you to work with the information slowly and
deliberately, and hence you're more likely to remember.

Typing lulls you into a false security of being able to quickly search and
look up information.  Writing forces you to scan manually, and so you end up
reviewing more ancillary information while searching for what you really want.

I started out typing to record the deluge of information, but ultimately I
ended up writing so I'd exercise my memory every time I had to rewrite a fact.


## Scratch work

Draw diagrams and simple tables.  Don't transcribe everything; these notes
should be much simpler than your textbooks and review.  Only record 1-2 key
distinguishing facts.  Those key facts will jog your memory of additional
ancillary facts.

Keep this all bound, in order (dated) in a
notebook so you can flip back ("Oh, I remember that from last week ... let me
find that ...").

When you revisit a topic, try to reproduce (redraw) as much as you can from
memory.  Resist the urge to immediately flip back in your notes.  Every time
you stretch your recall, it strengthens those neurons.  Every time you redraw
a diagram, you'll get faster.

I was dumb as bricks when it came to metabolic biochemistry.  Repeatedly
redrawing metabolic pathways was the only way I could get it through my thick
skull.

## QBanks

* Consider it part of learning process.
  * Don't wait to review everything before diving in.
  * Instead of reviewing, start with a small set of questions to get a
    sampling of what's important.  Only after that should you consider
    reviewing relevant topics.
* Learn as you go through the
* Your score on practice problems does not matter.  The only score that
  matters is that of the real exam.  As you're going through practice
  questions, the only important thing is that you're learning.
* If you're getting worn down with full blocks of 46 questions, do smaller
  blocks so you get more immediate feedback.  Similarly, if your worm down by
  low performance, smaller blocks might show an actual score improvement for
  some positive feedback to keep you motivated.


# STEP1

STEP1 will punish those who do not put in the time.  As a cumulative exam,
anything you failed to learn during your modules will show up here and cost
you points again.  If you didn't learn something the first time, now is your
last chance.

STEP1 is a test of endurance and discipline.  I'm not talking about test day.
I'm talking about endurance and discipline in the months leading up to test
day.  If you fail to work diligently during your dedicated period, you will be
punished.

STEP1 is also a very straight forward test for anyone willing to dedicate the
energy to working through question banks.  I would wager that simply
completing something like 6000 questions easily puts you in the 240s.  The
difference between the 240s and the 260s is where active studying and critical
self-assessment make the difference.
