email to priya:

You may want to consider handling email more like the "zero inbox"
principle. Google around for info on that. Basically, archive everything
you've read or dealt with and only leave in your inbox those things which
still require some action on your part. This way you don't reread the same
email or subject line more than once, and your inbox seems less daunting
