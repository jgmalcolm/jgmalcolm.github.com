Not sure what all is going through your mind, but your STEP1 score is not a
make-or-break score.  Do your best and move on to the next set of hurdles.
Your ERAS is a combination of scores, letters, grades, and research.  You only
need 2+ of those to get an interview, and after that it's more personality
than raw numbers.

I would definitely prioritize UWorld over Kaplan. Absolutely finish UWorld and
the two self assessments. Mark good questions and come back for a fast second
pass on those marked ones.

Only use Kaplan for extra questions in your weak areas. Even then, probably
best to repeat UW questions in those areas. But if you find you've memorized
the UW answers for those, then try Kaplan.

My NBME tests ranged, so having two hit similar doesn't say much. I did 5 NBME
and the 2 UW-SA. My scores ranged from 234-261 over the course of 10 days.

I would focus only in the last 10-14 days on timing. Until then, use un-timed
mode to go slowly and really think through questions and work on your
technique and thoroughly flesh out a process that works for you. Accuracy
before speed.

Ask yourself "Why did I get that wrong?" Really try to parse that out. Did you
misread? Did you over think? Were you able to see what the test writers were
going for? Did you narrow it down and guess wrong? Were you jumping at a
distractor? Did you narrow it down and give up and just guess? Did you simply
not have the requisite knowledge to answer? Did you rule out the correct
answer and, if so, why? Or was the correct answer still among the ones you did
not cross out?

Only use Pathoma where you need review. Don't simply plod through it. Goljan
however is really good to listen. I hit the treadmill an hour each day for
*focused* listening to one Goljan session each day. I swear, nearly every day
I got a question correct only because I had just heard that man talk about it.


Ultimately keep in mind that this test doesn't define who you are. It's
ridiculous how much pressure is placed on this one test value and faculty I
talk with say it's only one piece of a small puzzle.

If you know what you want to do, it's the things you do week after week after
week that get you there. Research, relationships, work ethic on
sub-internships, etc that get you in. Step1 is just one number they might use
to screen. They don't compare people like "student A is 225 versus Student B
who is 235"....no. The competitive programs compare based on letters and
research and relationships.


Do questions. That's the biggest thing you can do now that will effect your
grade. Stop undirected review and only do spot review. By now you should have
a pretty good idea of what you're weak in. Spend time there just memorizing
tables by rote so you stop bleeding points.

In your last week, focus on timing. Get closer to simulating the full test
experience. Start doing questions at the same time your exam will begin on
test day. Practice the marathon portion. Aim for 150-200 questions per day so
you start to understand your personal psychology when fatigued. Get some
experience working through that.

Something I wished I had allowed more time for: rest before the exam. Do <10
questions the day before the exam. You need to restore your energy before
walking in there.

Always keep in mind that this one test does not define you and that, if you
have dreams, you can always find a way to achieve them.
