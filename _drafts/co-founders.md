Setting out to build a new business is exciting, but there are important
things to consider as you're forming the founding team, whether it's with
friends, existing business partners, or a significant other.


## Personal

**Is this someone you like working with?** Can you see yourself working
together at 3am under a deadline?  Do they annoy you?  These are probably some
of the most important questions that will determine your happiness.  While
having an annoying partner is not a deal breaker, the baseline aggravation can
trigger bigger issues later.

**Is this person responsible?** Is this someone you trust to work hard and get
the job done?  The nature of forming a partnership is because you need to
spread work out, and so you need to be able to trust that your partner will
execute on their fair share.

**Do you share the same sense of values?** Do you question their judgment?
Have you witnessed or heard about them do anything ethically questionable?  If
so, be blunt and ask them about it.  Better to air the matter now rather than
after you've formed a joint bank account.


## Equity

> A beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances

* Equal split is best, unless you have a strong reason otherwise.
  * Anything other than equal will create a subtle imbalance.  The minor
    partners will feel less responsibility and show less initiative.
    * Some days you'll be the slug, and on those days you want to know that
      your partners are picking up the slack.
  * Even if one partner clearly brings more to the venture, think long and
    hard about tipping this balance.  You never know what the future holds,
    and likely you'll all end up growing in your rolls.
  * Instead of creating an imbalance from the start, look at the core
    competences and areas of the business and come up with a rough split that
    allows the would-be minor members to grow.
* Reasons for unequal:
  * Significant experience and maturity differences relevant to the venture.
  * Financial resources and capitalization


## Competencies

* What are core competencies needed for your venture?
  * Who brings what?
  * What do you need to get better at?
  * What will you outsource?

## Scenarios

* What happens if one partner walks in a year, two, four?
* What level of involvement is required to remain a partner?
  * How and when will you evaluate?
  * What's the process for pushing a partner out?

## Worst enemy

* Thought exercise: Assume this person is your worst enemy, you're involved in
  a divorce, and you're splitting the company assets.
* Don't just gloss over holes in the contract and assume you both understand
  what it means.  Make things explicit where you can.
