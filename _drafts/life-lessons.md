- When invited to a dinner or party, bring a bottle of wine.  Go the extra
  step of having some sort of small card attached to it with something simple
  like "Thank you for the evening -James".  This way, when ten other people
  bring a bottle, the host will later see your card when they go to enjoy the
  bottle and connect back to your friendship.
