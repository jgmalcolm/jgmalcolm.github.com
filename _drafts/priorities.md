Priorities are everything.

You can work very hard, be the hardest worker on your team, but if you're
working on the wrong things, you'll fail every single time.

Doing a high leverage, high priority task leaves you with an incredible
feeling.  Even if you have ten other lower priority things still on your list,
having done that one high priority task will leave you satisfied.  In
contrast, if you procrastinate and piddle away time on lower priority tasks,
you'll never be satisfied as long as that high priority task is staring you
down.

* Recognize when you're over-committed.
  * It's a terrible cloud to live under.  We all know that feeling; it just
    gnaws at your stomach.
  * People will start off assuming you're competent, but fail to deliver once
    and it'll take twice as much effort to get back to that baseline level of
    trust.
  * Be honest with people who are expecting things from you.  Give them a
    heads up so they can do their own contingency planning.
  * Steps to unwind commitments gracefully

You can use Time Boxing to force yourself to

You can use the Pareto Princple to work on the most valuable parts of a
project.

You can be efficient with your time and get more done faster.  You can spend
hours and hours reading productivity blogs that just help you do the wrong
thing faster.


Growing up is an undefined process.

I think that growing up means developing prioritization, defining priorities
and then executing in line with those priorities.

Becoming an executive at a small, fast growing startup is all about learning
to prioritize, execute, and measure.  If your situation is not overwhelming,
then you're probably not in a fast growing market.

My job is to pave the way.  To define targets, chart a course, communicate,
coordinate, and set standards for those that follow.


No one ever said "I got to where I am because I watched a lot of movies."  Cut
that shit out.
