Priorities are everything.

You can work very hard, be the hardest worker on your team, but if you're
working on the wrong things, you'll fail 100% of the time.

You can use Time Boxing to force yourself to

You can use the Pareto Princple to work on the most valuable parts of a
project.

You can be efficient with your time and get more done faster.  You can spend
hours and hours reading productivity blogs that just help you do the wrong
thing faster.


Growing up is an undefined process.

I think that growing up means developing prioritization, defining priorities
and then executing in line with those priorities.

Becoming an executive at a small, fast growing startup is all about learning
to prioritize, execute, and measure.  If your situation is not overwhelming,
then you're probably not in a fast growing market.

My job is to pave the way.  To define targets, chart a course, communicate,
coordinate, and set standards for those that follow.


No one ever said "I got to where I am because I watched a lot of movies."  Cut
that shit out.
