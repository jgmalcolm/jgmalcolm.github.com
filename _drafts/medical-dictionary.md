title: Free medical dictionary for Microsoft Word and PowerPoint
---

Getting tired of seeing red squiggly marks under your diverticula and
granulomas?  I recommend installing this medical dictionary on your computer
for MS Office. Getting tired of seeing nearly every other word in the lectures
have red squiggly marks.

Sidd: The instructions are for the older versions of word, so if you
have a newer version the way to add this is : File -> Options ->
Proofing -> Custom Dictionaries. Then click Add and find the
dictionary. The dictionary doesn't need to be in the specific folder
they mentioned.

order to select the .dic file)

Naman: MAC:

Make sure that a document is open.

On the Word menu, click Preferences.
Under Authoring and Proofing Tools, click Spelling and Grammar.
Under Spelling, click Dictionaries.
Click Add, and then locate and double-click the custom dictionary that you want to import.

If the custom dictionary doesn't have a file name extension of .dic, on the Enable pop-up menu, click All Files.
