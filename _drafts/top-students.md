What separates me from someone that's doing better than me?  What do they do
differently with their time?  Do they know something I don't know?

True story: Two students go to the library Saturday morning right when it
opens.  Instead of enjoying the beautiful weather, both students work hard
until the library closes.  Here's the kicker: they put in the *same amount of
time* but I bet they likely each learned very different amounts of material.

- excuses
  - they were a Bio major so they've already seen this stuff
  - all they do is study, so they won't have anything cool on their resume
  - they're just smarter ("I just wasn't born with brains.")
  - just a variant on the "victim" mentality

- focus --> [intensity][intensity]
  - job=learn  job!="curator of facebook funnies", "top tweeter", email/texts
    - phone in locker
- time - they simply put in the time, no shortcuts here
  - consistency
- synthesis - they determine what is important & what is context
  - active learning -> study guides
    - hand written
  - don't get bogged down in details
  - read but don't take time to squirrel them away for later
- spaced repetition
  - making a study guide != done studying
- work/life balance
  - leave all books at school
  - chronic micro-disappointment with self at not doing
  - "If you want to surprise people, do what you say you're going to do."

So stop wasting your Saturdays.  Study hard so you can play hard.
