What separates me from someone that's doing better than me?  What do they do
differently with their time?  Do they know something I don't know?

True story: Two students go to the library Saturday morning right when it
opens.  Instead of enjoying the beautiful weather, both students work hard
until the library closes.  Here's the kicker: they put in the *same amount of
time but I bet they likely each learned very different amounts of material*.
Same input but very different output.

This is a big topic, and this are just some cursory thoughts.  There's a lot
of "right" ways to study, but there are even more "wrong" ways, but if your
grades suck, then you're probably on the "wrong" track.

We live in unprecedented times.  This generation more than ever has the
opportunity to delay entering the workforce in order to develop skills.  The
tools and technology at our fingertips blows away anything available 20 years
ago: laptops, mobile, online tutorials, search.  Human potential is boundless,
and it's a shame when anyone squanders opportunity.

## Excuses

We often look at high achievers and see them as different.  We rationalize why
they're doing so well: they were a Bio major so they've already seen this med
school stuff before, all they do is study so they won't have anything cool on
their resume, they've just got more brains, etc.  These are all excuses.
Recognize them as such and instead find inspiration.

## Focus

- focus --> [intensity][intensity]
  - job=learn  job!="funniest facebook feed", "most pithy tweets", email/texts
    - phone in locker
- time - they simply put in the time, no shortcuts here
  - consistency
- synthesis - they determine what is important & what is context
  - active learning -> study guides
    - hand written
    - testing (not just passive reading)
  - don't get bogged down in details
  - read but don't take time to squirrel them away for later
- spaced repetition
  - making a study guide != done studying
- work/life balance
  - leave all books at school
  - chronic micro-disappointment with self at not doing
  - "If you want to surprise people, do what you say you're going to do."

Don't expect to become a top student over night, but you should be better than
you were yesterday.

So stop wasting your Saturdays.  Study hard so you can play hard.
