What separates me from someone that's doing better than me?  What do they do
differently with their time?  Do they know something I don't know?

True story: Two students go to the library in the morning right when it opens
on a Saturday.  Both students work hard until the library closes.  Instead of
enjoying the beautiful weather, they both sacrificed the better part of a
weekend to their studies.  Here's the kicker: they likely diverged
*significantly* in what they each got out of that *same amount of time*.

- excuses
  - they were a Bio major so they've already seen this stuff
  - all they do is study, so they won't have anything cool on their resume
  - they're just smarter

- focus --> [intensity][intensity]
  - job=learn  job!="curator of facebook funnies", "top tweeter", "prompt emailer"
- time - they simply put in the time, no shortcuts here
- synthesis - determine what is important & what is context
  - don't get bogged down in details
- spaced repetition
  - making a study guide != done studying
- consistency

So stop wasting your Saturdays.  Study hard so you can play hard.
