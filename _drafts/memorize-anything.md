Many fields require students to memorize some basic set of facts at the start.
With those planted in memory, you progress to learning how to reason.  This
article outlines simple steps for committing seemingly random facts to memory
using your powerful visual and emotional senses.



## Simple

**Use what immediately pops into your head.** Run with that natural
association, eg.  penicillin = pencil.

**Don't be afraid to stew.** If nothing immediately comes to mind, don't be
afraid to mull around for a while until you find something that really fits.
Play with the word some.  Roll it around in your mouth.  Pronounce it in
various ways.  Look for a synonym.  Instead of representing the word directly,
represent a key fact about the concept.  Use a dictionary to find other words
that begin with the same first few letters.

**Trigger off most characteristic syllable.** Unless every syllable is
important, just use the one with most emphasis.

**Use easily recognizable objects.** If the object is too complicated or
unusually decorated, it might get blurred in your visual memory.  Use dynamic
action to make things memorable.

**Only include salient features.** Ignore details in the initial stages.  As
you become an expert in a topic, the details just naturally associate with the
topic in your mind.  There is less need to fit them in at the beginning of
scene formation.



## Vivid pictures

  * Evoke a visceral or emotional reaction.
    * Dynamic scenes
    * Making the scene real to you: walk around it, push something around,
      focus on details, smell, taste, touch
  * Examples


## Context

  * Come up with a scene to wrap all your objects.  A consistent theme can
    increase the connections binding all your symbols together.  Paint a
    background.
    * For example, if you recall that the entire scene was set in a farm field
      but you're forgetting one area, you have a better chance of narrowing it
      down as you try to recall common farm objects likely present.  If the
      scene had been too ridiculous and involved completely unrelated objects,
      then good luck.  You're screwed.


## Numbers
  * In [Mnemonic Major System][wiki] each digit maps to a unique consonant.
    To remember a sequence of digits, start with the consonants mapped from
    each digit and form a memorable word by adding vowels as needed.

## Sequences

* Sequences require a "memory palace" to provide order.
* A very familiar location (home, school)
  * Separate rooms and physical space to avoid crowding
  * Aim for about five objects per a space.
* Spend time walking through this space and examining the "stopping spots"
  where you will later place objects.

## Getting faster

There is an up-front cost of time spent generating a scene, but I've found
that I don't have to restudy material which saves me time overall.  Even more,
as I've practiced constructing scenes, the process has become faster.  I'm
faster now at coming up with symbols, associations, and an integrated scene.

Spaced repetition is an efficient algorithm for scheduling when to revisit a
weak topic, but it does nothing to help you when you're actually trying to
absorb the specific topic material.  Sometimes I felt like I was getting hit
in head with a hammer repeatedly every time I encountered the same topic day
after day, each time unable to actually absorb and assimilate the details for
any meaningful retention.
