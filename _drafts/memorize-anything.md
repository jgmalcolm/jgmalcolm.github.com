Many fields require students to memorize some basic set of facts at the start.
With those planted in memory, you progress to learning how to reason.  This
article outlines simple rules for committing seemingly random facts to memory
using your powerful visual and emotional senses.

There's an up-front cost of time spent generating a scene.

Spaced repetition is an efficient algorithm for scheduling when to revisit a
weak topic, but it does nothing to help you when you're actually trying to
absorb the specific topic material.  Sometimes I felt like I was getting hit
in head with a hammer repeatedly every time I encountered the same topic day
after day, each time unable to actually absorb and assimilate the details for
any meaningful retention.


## Simple rules

* Similar sounding.
  * Pick among the first few things that immediately pop into your head.
  * Examples
    * Penicillamine - pencil

* Vivid pictures.
  * Evoke a visceral or emotional reaction.
    * Dynamic scenes
    * Making the scene real to you: walk around it, push something around,
      focus on details, smell, taste, touch
  * Examples

* Simple
  * Trigger off most characteristic syllable
    * Don't sound out every syllable of a fact (unless every syllable is
      actually important).
  * Use everyday objects where possible.  If the object is too complicated or
    unusually decorated, it might get blurred in visual memory.  Use dynamic
    action to make things memorable.

* Context
  * Come up with a scene to wrap all your objects.  A consistent theme can
    increase the connections binding all your symbols together.  Paint a
    background.
    * For example,

## Numbers
  * In [Mnemonic Major System][wiki] each digit maps to a unique consonant.
    To remember a sequence of digits, start with the consonants mapped from
    each digit and form a memorable word by adding vowels as needed.

## Sequences

* Sequences require a "memory palace" to provide order.
* A very familiar location (home, school)
  * Separate rooms and physical space to avoid crowding
  * Aim for about five objects per a space.
* Spend time walking through this space and examining the "stopping spots"
  where you will later place objects.
