<img class="bookcover" src="/images/books/washington.jpg"> George Washington
was the commanding general in the American Colonial Revolution, reluctant
political figure, and by his actions defined the role of President of the
United States.

## Take away points

* He was chronically in debt.  Since the war and presidency consumed his
  attention, his farm crops were chronically unsuccessful and often ran at a
  loss.  On top of that, he liked nice things: shopping sprees whenever he
  traveled, ordering the latest fashions from Europe.  After assuming the
  presidency, he ceased to purchase from Europe and instead focused one
  wearing "Made in the USA" clothing to show his support.

* Even though many colonists used the successful ending of the revolution as
  an excuse to not repay debts owed to British, Washington made a point to pay
  down his personal debts.  Hyper-inflation of the colonial currency made it
  more difficult for him to collect on the debts he was owed by land tenants
  and such.
