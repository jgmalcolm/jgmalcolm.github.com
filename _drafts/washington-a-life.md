</figure>

George Washington was a British officer, the commanding general in the
American Colonial Revolution, reluctant political figure, and by his actions
defined the role of President of the United States.

## Talking Points

* Washington was chronically in debt.  With the war and presidency consuming
  his attention, his farm crops were chronically unsuccessful and often ran at
  a loss.  On top of that, he liked nice things: shopping sprees whenever he
  traveled, ordering the latest fashions from Europe.  After assuming the
  presidency, he ceased to purchase from Europe and instead focused one
  wearing "Made in the USA" clothing to show his support.

* Even though many colonists used the successful ending of the revolution as
  an excuse to not repay debts owed to British, Washington made a point to pay
  down his personal debts.  Unfortunately, hyper-inflation of the colonial
  currency made it more difficult for him to collect on the debts he was owed
  by land tenants and such.

* During the revolution, each state went into debt, both domestic and foreign.
  Alexander Hamilton, the first Treasury Secretary, proposed the federal
  government assume all state debt.  Having just thrown off one tyrannical
  government, many states feared now being indebted to a new master, but
  ultimately the plan prevailed.  The most important effect of pooling debt in
  this new government was to bind the states into a union under one bank.

Corollary: Waste a dollar and you can always later earn a dollar to replace
it, but waste an hour and it's gone forever.

> A master of the profitable use of time, Washington listed his monthly doings

> business or social occasions, his punctuality was legendary, and he expected
> everyone to be on time. In his business dealings, he boasted that “no man

> than I do.”

> involved tasks that distinguished his life. “System in all things is the
> soul of business,” he liked to say. “To deliberate maturely and execute
> promptly is the way to conduct it to advantage.”

> Washington benefited from the unvarying regularity of his daily routine and
> found nothing monotonous about it. Like many thrifty farmers, he rose before
> sunrise and accomplished much work while others still slept. Prior to
> breakfast, he shuffled about in dressing gown and slippers and passed an
> hour or two in his library, reading and handling correspondence. He also
> devoted time to private prayers before Billy Lee laid out his clothes,
> brushed his hair, and tied it in a queue. Washington liked to examine his
> stables before breakfast, inspect his horses, and issue instructions to the
> grooms. Then he had an unchanging breakfast of corn cakes, tea, and honey.

> Washington couldn't bear anything slovenly. “I shall begrudge no reasonable
> expense that will contribute to the improvement and neatness of my farms,
> for nothing pleases me better than to see them in good order and everything
> trim, handsome, and thriving about them,” he advised one estate
> manager. “Nor nothing hurts me more than to find them otherwise and the
> tools and implements laying wherever they were last used, exposed to
> injuries from rain, sun, etc.”  No detail was too trivial to escape his
> notice, and he often spouted the Scottish adage “Many mickles make a
> muckle”—that is, tiny things add up.

That reminds me of the

that so changed NYC.

> Washington made sure that he returned for dinner precisely at 2:45 P.M. when
> the first bell sounded for the large midday meal. According to legend, the
> clatter of his approaching hooves often coincided with the bell's loud
> clang. Washington then washed, dressed, powdered his hair, and appeared in
> the dining room by the stroke of three. He preferred a dinner of fish from
> the Potomac and typically ate with a hearty appetite. In this heavy-drinking

> removed, and Washington would lift his glass with his habitual toast to “All
> our friends.”  He then retired to his library before a light supper. Before

> or backgammon.

Not too long ago, our activities were in sync with the rise and fall of the
Sun.  Of course, electricity and the light bulb changed all that.

Washington was the original
[quantified self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_Self):

> To maintain a detailed grasp of his vast operations, Washington kept
> comprehensive records long before such bookkeeping was commonplace. Being a

> went far beyond such basics. “He also makes copious notes in writing
> relative to his own experiments, the state of the seasons, nature of soils,
> effect of different kinds of manure, and everything that can throw light on
> the farming business,” wrote his later aide David Humphreys. Everything was
> perfectly sorted, classified, and slotted in his compartmentalized mind and
> books. Washington's contemporaries recognized that this compulsive note
> taking, this itch to record his every action, went to the very essence of
> this well-regulated man. “You would be surprised to find what a uniform life
> he leads,” wrote John Hancock's nephew after a visit to Mount
> Vernon. “Everything he does is by method of system . . . He keeps a journal
> where he records everything . . . he is a model of the highest perfection.”



## Revolution

If Britain had treated colonists as first class citizens, the revolution might
have never have reached critical mass, and America might still be a colony.

> Washington's first stirrings of anti-British fervor had arisen from his
> failure to receive a royal commission, but they were now joined by
> disenchantment over pocketbook issues. Great Britain was simply bad for
> local business, a fact that would soon foster the historical anomaly of a
> revolution inaugurated by affluent, conservative leaders. As potentates of
> vast estates, lords of every acre they saw, George Washington and other
> planters didn't care to truckle to a distant, unseen power.

It's easy to think that all the Founding Fathers were roughly the same age.
They were all in different stages of life.  Franklin was the elderly
grandfatherly figure.  Washington was not much younger.  Jefferson was just a
student.

> In the House of Burgesses, a young rabble-rouser, Patrick Henry, rose amid
> the dark wooden benches and brandished fiery resolutions. “Resolved,” he
> announced, “that the taxation of the people by themselves or by persons
> chosen by themselves to represent them . . . is the distinguishing
> characteristic of British freedom.” For a young law student standing in the
> rear of the hushed chamber, these words sounded with a thrilling
> resonance. “He appeared to me to speak as Homer wrote,” Thomas Jefferson
> remembered.

Washington's personal debt burden weighted heavily on his shoulders and
factored keenly into his thoughts on secession.  His insight here into the
psychology of debt is as true today as it was then.

> On April 5, 1769, Washington sent Mason a remarkable letter that gave both
> his private and his public reasons for supporting a boycott of British
> goods. Doubtless thinking of his own plight, he said a boycott would break
> the onerous cycle of debt that trapped many colonists, purging their
> extravagant spending. Before this the average colonial debtor was too weak
> to break this habit, “for how can I, says he, who have lived in such and
> such a manner, change my method? . . . besides, such an alteration in the
> system of my living will create suspicions of a decay in my fortune and such
> a thought the world must not harbor.” **Washington provided here a key
> insight into the psychology of debt: fear that any attempt at a more frugal
> existence would disclose the truth about a person's actual wealth.**

Declaring an official revolt was dangerous.  For these colonists, it was an
all or nothing decision.  If they failed, they knew what fate awaited them.
They risked everything.

> The Declaration made the rebels' treason official and reminded them of the
> unspeakable punishments the British government meted out for this
> offense. Only recently a British judge had handed down this grisly sentence
> to Irish revolutionaries: “You are to be drawn on hurdles to the place of
> execution, where you are to be hanged by the neck, but not until you are
> dead, for while you are still living your bodies are to be taken down, your
> bowels torn out and burned before your faces, your heads then cut off, and
> your bodies divided each into four quarters.”

The French revolution came soon after the American revolution, but both were
founded on very different ideals.

> An essential difference between the American and French revolutions was that
> the American version allowed a search for many truths, while French zealots
> tried to impose a single sacred truth that allowed no deviation.





## Personal

Washington was chronically in debt.

> Money was the one area where Washington tended to dodge personal
> responsibility and blame force majeure.

> While public life forced Washington into expenditures beyond his control,
> during his entire adult life he had exhibited an inability to live within
> his means.

Throughout the war, Washington was torn between the crumbling colonial army
and his crumbling personal property.

> Washington must have been distressed by the creeping signs of decay
> everywhere. Whatever the war's outcome, he would be left a poorer man, which
> weighed heavily on his mind. That June, in a letter to William Crawford, the
> steward of his western lands, he broke down and confided his concern about
> his wealth withering away as the war progressed: “My whole time is . . . so
> much engrossed by the public duties of my station that I have totally
> neglected all my private concerns, which are declining every day, and may
> possibly end in capital losses, if not absolute ruin, before I am at liberty
> to look after them.”

> The pastel portrait that Williams executed on September 18, 1794, shows a
> particularly dour, cranky Washington, with a tightly turned-down
> mouth. Posing in a black coat, he wears Masonic symbols on a blue sash that
> slants diagonally across his chest. His face is neither friendly nor heroic
> but looks like that of a bad-tempered relative, suggesting that the

> its accuracy, the Williams portrait shows various blemishes on Washington's
> face—a scar that curves under the pouch of his left eye; a mole below his
> right earlobe; smallpox scars on both his nose and cheeks—ordinarily edited
> out of highly sanitized portraits.


## Was Washington a Christian?

If he was, then he didn't make that clear in the least.  He seems more like a
deist.

> A stalwart member of two congregations, Washington attended church
> throughout his life and devoted substantial time to church activities. His
> major rites of passage—baptism, marriage, burial—all took place within the
> fold of the church. What has mystified posterity and puzzled some of his
> contemporaries was that Washington's church attendance was irregular; that
> he recited prayers standing instead of kneeling; that, unlike Martha, he
> never took communion; and that he almost never referred to Jesus Christ,
> preferring such vague locutions as “Providence,” “Destiny,” the “Author of
> our Being,” or simply “Heaven.” Outwardly at least, his Christianity seemed
> rational, shorn of mysteries and miracles, and nowhere did he directly
> affirm the divinity of Jesus Christ.

> Numerous historians, viewing Washington as imbued with the spirit of the
> Enlightenment, have portrayed him as a deist. Eighteenth-century deists
> thought of God as a “prime mover” who had created the universe, then left it
> to its own devices, much as a watchmaker wound up a clock and walked
> away. God had established immutable laws of nature that could be fathomed by
> human reason instead of revelation. Washington never conformed to such
> deism, however, for he resided in a universe saturated with religious
> meaning. Even if his God was impersonal, with scant interest in individual
> salvation, He seemed to evince a keen interest in North American
> politics. Indeed, in Washington's view, He hovered over many battlefields in
> the French and Indian War and the Revolutionary War.




## Government

Washington presided over a rabble citizenry that just toppled its previous
government.  Always conscious of its populist tendencies, he tried to shepherd
gently.

> One virtue of a war that dragged on for so many years was that it gave the
> patriots a long gestation period in which to work out the rudiments of a
> federal government, financial mechanisms, diplomatic alliances, and other
> elements of a modern nation-state.

> Try though he might, Washington couldn't completely extricate his thoughts
> from politics and feared that the still immature country would blunder into
> errors before arriving at true wisdom. As he affirmed, “all things will come
> right at last. But, like a young heir come a little prematurely to a large
> inheritance, we shall wanton and run riot until we have brought our
> reputation to the brink of ruin.” Only when a crisis materialized would the
> country be “compelled perhaps to do what prudence and common policy pointed
> out as plain as any problem in Euclid in the first instance.” This statement
> tallied with Washington's often expressed view that citizens had to feel
> before they saw—that is, they couldn't react to abstract problems, only to
> tangible ones.

> The long fight against British tyranny, paradoxically, only strengthened his
> view that the foremost political danger came not from an overly powerful
> central government but from an enfeebled one—“a half-starved, limping
> government that appears to be always moving upon crutches and tottering at
> every step.”

> Shays's Rebellion crystallized for him the need to overhaul the Articles of
> Confederation. “What stronger evidence can be given of the want of energy in
> our governments than these disorders?” he asked Madison. “If there exists
> not a power to check them, what security has a man of life, liberty, or
> property?”


> He also knew that the American public needed to contribute its share; the
> Constitution “can only lay the foundation—the community at large must raise
> the edifice.”


> Closer in tone to future inaugural speeches was his ringing expression of
> faith in the American people. He devised a perfect formulation of popular
> sovereignty, writing that the Constitution had brought forth “a government
> of the people: that is to say, a government in which all power is derived
> from, and at stated periods reverts to, them—and that, in its operation
> . . . is purely a government of laws made and executed by the fair
> substitutes of the people alone.”


> A whirlwind of energy, Madison would seem omnipresent in the early days of
> Washington's administration. He drafted not only the inaugural address but
> also the official response by Congress and then Washington's response to
> Congress, completing the circle.

> Although Washington seemed unaware of it, Hamilton had been training for the
> Treasury post throughout the war, boning up on subjects as diverse as
> foreign exchange and central banks. Like Washington, Knox, and other
> Continental Army officers, Hamilton had perceived an urgent need for an
> active central government, and he grasped the reins of power with a
> sure-handed gusto that set the tenor for the administration. He headed a
> Treasury Department that, with thirty-nine employees, instantly surpassed
> the rest of the government in size. Of particular importance, he presided
> over an army of customs inspectors whose import duties served as the
> government's main revenue source.

> In its sparsely worded style, the Constitution mandated that the president,
> from time to time, should give Congress information about the state of the
> Union, but it was Washington who turned this amorphous injunction into a
> formal speech before both houses of Congress, establishing another
> precedent. Trailing him in his entourage were the chief justice and members
> of his cabinet, leading to yet another tradition: that the State of the
> Union speech (then called the annual address) would feature leading figures
> from all three branches of government. Everything about the new government
> still had an improvised feel, and Washington's advent occasioned some
> last-minute scurrying in the Senate chamber.


> Hamilton was also persuaded that, since the debt had been raised to finance
> a national war, the federal government should assume responsibility for the
> states' debts as well. Such an act of “assumption” would have
> extraordinarily potent political effects, for holders of state debt would
> transfer their loyalty to the new central government, binding the country
> together. It would also reinforce the federal government's claim to future
> tax revenues in any controversies with the states.


> Washington had ten days to sign or veto the bank bill and stalled in making
> up his mind. Perhaps by design, Hamilton delivered, and Washington accepted,
> the argument in favor of the bill right before that deadline expired,
> leaving no time for an appeal inside the cabinet. When Washington signed the
> bill on February 25, 1791, it was a courageous act, for he defied the legal
> acumen of Madison, Jefferson, and Randolph. Unlike his fellow planters, who
> tended to regard banks and stock exchanges as sinister devices, Washington
> grasped the need for these instruments of modern finance. It was also a
> decisive moment legally for Washington, who had felt more bound than
> Hamilton by the literal words of the Constitution. With this stroke, he
> endorsed an expansive view of the presidency and made the Constitution a
> living, open-ended document. The importance of his decision is hard to
> overstate, for had Washington rigidly adhered to the letter of the
> Constitution, the federal government might have been stillborn. Chief
> Justice John Marshall later seized upon the doctrine of “implied powers” and
> incorporated it into seminal Supreme Court cases that upheld the power of
> the federal government.

> Washington and other founders entertained the fanciful hope that America
> would be spared the bane of political parties, which they called “factions”
> and associated with parochial self-interest. The first president did not see
> that parties might someday clarify choices for the electorate, organize
> opinion, and enlist people in the political process; rather he feared that
> parties could blight a still fragile republic. He was hardly alone. “If I
> could not go to heaven but with a party,” Jefferson opined, “I would not go
> there at all.” Yet the first factions arose from Jefferson's extreme
> displeasure with Hamilton's mounting influence. They were not political
> parties in the modern sense so much as clashing coteries of intellectual
> elites, who operated through letters and conversations instead of meetings,
> platforms, and conventions. Nonetheless these groups solidified into parties
> during the decade and, notwithstanding the founders' fears, formed an
> enduring cornerstone of American democratic politics.


> However trying he often found the press, Washington understood its
> importance in a democracy and voraciously devoured gazettes. Before becoming
> president, he had lauded newspapers and magazines as “easy vehicles of
> knowledge, more happily calculated than any other to preserve the liberty
> . . . and meliorate the morals of an enlightened and free people.” In his
> unused first inaugural address, he had gone so far as to advocate free
> postal service for periodicals. As press criticism mounted, however,
> Washington struggled to retain his faith in an independent press. In October
> 1792 he told Gouverneur Morris that he regretted that newspapers exaggerated
> political discontent in the country, but added that “this kind of
> representation is an evil w[hi]ch must be placed in opposition to the
> infinite benefits resulting from a free press.” A month later, in a more
> somber mood, he warned Jefferson that Freneau's invective would yield
> pernicious results: “These articles tend to produce a separation of the
> Union, the most dreadful of calamities; and whatever tends to produce
> anarchy, tends, of course, to produce a resort to monarchical government.”

> At the end he struck a note of serenity, a faith that the American
> experiment, if sometimes threatened, would prevail. While fearful of
> machinations, he told Trumbull, “I trust . . . that the good sense of our
> countrymen will guard the public weal against this and every other
> innovation and that, altho[ugh] we may be a little wrong now and then, we
> shall return to the right path with more avidity.” 15 It was an accurate
> forecast of American history, both its tragic lapses and its miraculous
> redemptions.


> The presidential legacy he left behind in Philadelphia was a towering
> one. As Gordon Wood has observed, “The presidency is the powerful office it
> is in large part because of Washington's initial behavior.” Washington had
> forged the executive branch of the federal government, appointed outstanding
> department heads, and set a benchmark for fairness, efficiency, and
> integrity that future administrations would aspire to match. “A new
> government, constructed on free principles, is always weak and must stand in
> need of the props of a firm and good administration till time shall have
> rendered its authority venerable and fortified it by habits of obedience,”
> Hamilton wrote. Washington had endowed the country with exactly such a firm
> and good administration, guaranteeing the survival of the Constitution. He
> had taken the new national charter and converted it into a viable, elastic
> document. In a wide variety of areas, from inaugural addresses to
> presidential protocol to executive privilege, he had set a host of
> precedents that endured because of the high quality and honesty of his
> decisions. Washington's catalog of accomplishments was simply
> breathtaking. He had restored American credit and assumed state debt;
> created a bank, a mint, a coast guard, a customs service, and a diplomatic
> corps; introduced the first accounting, tax, and budgetary procedures;
> maintained peace at home and abroad; inaugurated a navy, bolstered the army,
> and shored up coastal defenses and infrastructure; proved that the country
> could regulate commerce and negotiate binding treaties; protected frontier
> settlers, subdued Indian uprisings, and established law and order amid
> rebellion, scrupulously adhering all the while to the letter of the
> Constitution. During his successful presidency, exports had soared, shipping
> had boomed, and state taxes had declined dramatically. Washington had also
> opened the Mississippi to commerce, negotiated treaties with the Barbary
> states, and forced the British to evacuate their northwestern forts. Most of
> all he had shown a disbelieving world that republican government could
> prosper without being spineless or disorderly or reverting to authoritarian
> rule. In surrendering the presidency after two terms and overseeing a smooth
> transition of power, Washington had demonstrated that the president was
> merely the servant of the people.


> Washington never achieved the national unity he desired and, by the end,
> presided over a deeply riven country. John Adams made a telling point when
> he later noted that Washington, an apostle of unity, “had unanimous votes as
> president, but the two houses of Congress and the great body of the people
> were more equally divided under him than they ever have been since.” This
> may have been unavoidable as the new government implemented the new
> Constitution, which provoked deep splits over its meaning and the country's
> future direction. But whatever his chagrin about the partisan strife,
> Washington never sought to suppress debate or clamp down on his shrill
> opponents in the press who had hounded him mercilessly. To his everlasting
> credit, he showed that the American political system could manage tensions
> without abridging civil liberties. His most flagrant failings remained those
> of the country as a whole—the inability to deal forthrightly with the
> injustice of slavery or to figure out an equitable solution in the ongoing
> clashes with Native Americans.



## Martha

The Presidency clearly took its toll on Washington and his family, as I'm sure
every Presidency since then has.

> To the end of her life, Martha Washington would speak forlornly of the
> presidential years as her “lost days.”

> Martha Washington had sacrificed so much privacy during her married life
> that after her husband died, she evened the score by burning their personal
> correspondence—to the everlasting chagrin of historians.





## Leadership

> Whether on the plantation, in the army, or in government, he stressed the
> need to inspire respect rather than affection in subordinates, a common
> thread running through his vastly disparate managerial activities.


> When General Howe herded 300 destitute Bostonians, riddled with disease,
> onto boats and dumped them near American lines, Washington feared that they
> carried smallpox; he sent them humanitarian provisions while carefully
> insulating them from his troops. After a second wave of 150 sickly
> Bostonians was expelled, Washington grew convinced that Howe had stooped to
> using smallpox as a “weapon of defense” against his army. By January 1777 he
> ordered Dr. William Shippen to inoculate every soldier who had never had the
> disease. “Necessity not only authorizes but seems to require the measure,”
> he wrote, “for should the disorder infect the army in the natural way and
> rage with its usual virulence, we should have more to dread from it than the
> sword of the enemy.” This enlightened decision was as important as any
> military measure Washington adopted during the war.


> Washington tried to rouse his untried men with impassioned words. He had a
> genius for exalting the mission of his army and enabling the men to see
> themselves, not as lowly grunts, but as actors on the stage of history. “The
> time is now near at hand which must probably determine whether Americans are
> to be free men or slaves . . . The fate of unborn millions will now depend,
> under God, on the courage . . . of this army.”

> Finally he was stranded alone on the battlefield with his aides, his troops
> having fled in fright. Most astonishingly, Washington on horseback stared
> frozen as fifty British soldiers started to dash toward him from eighty
> yards away. Seeing his strangely catatonic state, his aides rode up beside
> him, grabbed the reins of his horse, and hustled him out of danger. In this
> bizarre conduct, Nathanael Greene saw a suicidal impulse, contending that
> Washington was “so vexed at the infamous conduct of his troops that he
> sought death rather than life.” Weedon added the compelling detail that only
> with difficulty did Washington's colleagues “get him to quit the field, so
> great was his emotions.” It was a moment unlike any other in Washington's
> career, a fleeting emotional breakdown amid battle.


> He seemed to know implicitly that no loyalty surpassed that of a man
> forgiven for his faults who vowed never to make them again.


> Yet despite the calamities at Forts Washington and Lee, the British had done
> Washington an inadvertent favor. They had shown him the futility of trying
> to defend heavily fortified positions along the seaboard and forced him out
> into the countryside, where he had mobility and where the British Army,
> deprived of the Royal Navy, operated at a disadvantage. For political
> reasons, Washington hadn't been able to countermand the congressional
> decision to defend New York City and the Hudson River, but now that he had
> done so and suffered predictable defeats, he would have more freedom to pick
> and choose his targets. With his drastically diminished army and depleted
> supplies, it was no longer a question of standing and confronting the
> British with their vastly superior troops and firepower.


> English poet Edward Young: “ ‘Affliction is the good man's shining time.'”


> Washington demanded self-sacrifice from aides, who had to follow his
> schedule uncomplainingly. If he slept in the open air before a battle, so
> did they. “When I joined His Excellency's suite,” wrote James McHenry, “I
> gave up soft beds, undisturbed repose, and the habits of ease and indulgence
> . . . for a single blanket, the hard floor or the softer sod of the fields,
> early rising, and almost perpetual duty.”


> Washington was adept at identifying young talent. He wanted eager young men
> who worked well together, pitched in with alacrity, and showed esprit de
> corps. His own personality forbade backslapping familiarity or easy
> joviality. Beneath his reserve, however, he had an excellent capacity for
> reading people and adapting his personality to them. As before the war, he
> remained wary in relationships and lowered his emotional barriers only
> slowly, but he was trusting once colleagues earned his confidence.

> Since the Battle of Monmouth, Washington had soldiered on for more than two
> years without a major battle, and Lafayette told him of impatience at
> Versailles with his supposed passivity. Washington replied that this
> inactivity was involuntary: “It is impossible, my dear Marquis, to desire
> more ardently than I do to terminate the campaign by some happy stroke, but
> we must consult our means rather than our wishes.”

> Washington surrounded himself with a small but decidedly stellar group. With
> his own renown secure, he had no fear that subordinates would upstage him
> and never wanted subservient courtiers whom he could overshadow. Aware of
> his defective education, he felt secure in having the best minds at his
> disposal. He excelled as a leader precisely because he was able to choose
> and orchestrate bright, strong personalities. As Gouverneur Morris observed,
> Washington knew “how best to use the rays” given off by the sparkling
> geniuses at his command. 9 As the first president, Washington assembled a
> group of luminaries without equal in American history; his first cabinet
> more than made up in intellectual fire-power what it lacked in numbers.

> Washington's accomplishments as president were no less groundbreaking than
> his deeds in the Continental Army. It is a grave error to think of George
> Washington as a noble figurehead presiding over a group of prima donnas who
> performed the real work of government. As a former commander in chief, he
> was accustomed to a chain of command and delegating important duties, but he
> was also accustomed to having the final say. As president, he enjoyed
> unparalleled power without being autocratic. He set out less to implement a
> revolutionary agenda than to construct a sturdy, well-run government, and in
> the process he performed many revolutionary acts.

> Washington grew as a leader because he engaged in searching
> self-criticism. “I can bear to hear of imputed or real errors,” he once
> wrote. “The man who wishes to stand well in the opinion of others must do
> this, because he is thereby enabled to correct his faults or remove
> prejudices which are imbibed against him.” The one thing Washington could
> not abide was when people published criticisms of him without first giving
> him a chance to respond privately.

> [H]e summed up his executive style: “Much was to be done by prudence, much
> by conciliation, much by firmness.”

> Hamilton concurred that the president “consulted much, pondered much;
> resolved slowly, resolved surely.”

> Well aware of his own executive style, Washington once instructed a cabinet
> member “to deliberate maturely, but to execute promptly and vigorously.”


> Washington once advised his adopted grandson that “where there is no
> occasion for expressing an opinion, it is best to be silent, for there is
> nothing more certain than that it is at all times more easy to make enemies
> than friends.”


> A taciturn man, Washington never issued opinions promiscuously. A
> disciplined politician, he never had to retract things uttered in a
> thoughtless moment. “Never be agitated by more than a decent warmth and
> offer your sentiments with modest diffidence,” he told his nephew Bushrod,
> noting that “opinions thus given are listened to with more attention than
> when delivered in a dictatorial style.” He worried about committing an error
> more than missing a brilliant stroke. Washington also hated boasting.

> By the time of his death, Washington had poured his last ounce of passion
> into the creation of his country. Never a perfect man, he always had a
> normal quota of human frailty, including a craving for money, status, and
> fame. Ambitious and self-promoting in his formative years, he had remained a
> tightfisted, sharp-elbowed businessman and a hard-driving slave master. But
> over the years, this man of deep emotions and strong opinions had learned to
> subordinate his personal dreams and aspirations to the service of a larger
> cause, evolving into a statesman with a prodigious mastery of political
> skills and an unwavering sense of America's future greatness. In the things

## Notable Events

> Philadelphia. It must have dawned on him just how annoyed Washington was by
> his protracted absence, for he sent him a letter awash with “inexpressible
> regret that an extraordinary course of contrary winds” had delayed his

> your return in time would have allowed it. It is now too late.” This was a

> the largest military operation to unfold since the Revolutionary War. In
> addition to giving Knox a stinging rap on the knuckles, Washington must also
> have seen that Hamilton had assumed a commanding posture and would have
> yielded to Knox only with reluctance.



## Anti-slavery

> Whatever his motivations, it was a water-shed moment in American history,
> opening the way for approximately five thousand blacks to serve in the
> Continental Army, making it the most integrated American fighting force
> before the Vietnam War. At various times, blacks would make up anywhere from
> 6 to 12 percent of Washington's army.

> That winter the projected shortage of soldiers led Washington to introduce
> another significant change in policy. In January 1778 Brigadier General
> James Mitchell Varnum of Rhode Island asked the unthinkable of the Virginia
> planter:  the right to augment his state's forces by recruiting black
> troops. “It is imagined that a battalion of Negroes can be easily raised
> there,” he assured Washington. Washington knew this was an incendiary idea
> for many southerners. Nevertheless, desperate to recruit more manpower, he
> gave his stamp of approval, telling Rhode Island's governor “that you will
> give the officers employed in this business all the assistance in your
> power.” The state promised to free any slaves willing to join an all-black
> battalion that soon numbered 130 men. Massachusetts followed Rhode Island's
> lead in enlisting black soldiers, and in Connecticut, slave masters were
> exempt from military service if they sent slaves in their stead. That August
> a census listed 755 blacks as part of the Continental Army, or nearly 5
> percent of the total force.

> By freeing his slaves, Washington accomplished something more glorious than
> any battlefield victory as a general or legislative act as a president. He
> did what no other founding father dared to do, although all proclaimed a
> theoretical revulsion at slavery. He brought the American experience that
> much closer to the ideals of the American Revolution and brought his own
> behavior in line with his troubled conscience.




## Governance

> In early January, amid rumors of mass resignations, a three-man delegation
> of officers went to Philadelphia to lay before Congress a petition that
> catalogued their pent-up grievances: “We have borne all that men can
> bear—our property is expended—our private resources are at an end.” This
> delegation met with two dynamic young members of Congress: James Madison of
> Virginia, a member since 1780, and Alexander Hamilton of New York, who had
> joined Congress a little more than a month earlier. However alarmed by the
> prospect of an officer mutiny, Hamilton believed it might represent a handy
> lever with which to budge a lethargic Congress from inaction, leading to
> expanded federal powers. On February 13 Hamilton wrote to Washington in a
> candid tone that presupposed that a profound understanding still existed
> between them. He talked of the critical state of American finances and
> suggested that the officer revolt could be helpful: “The claims of the army,
> urged with moderation but with firmness, may operate on those weak minds
> which are influenced by their apprehensions rather than their judgment
> . . . But the difficulty will be to keep a complaining and suffering army
> within the bounds of moderation.” In suggesting that Washington exploit the
> situation to influence Congress, Hamilton toyed with combustible
> chemicals. He also tried to awaken anxiety in Washington by telling him that
> officers were whispering that he didn't stand up for their rights with
> sufficient zeal. “The falsehood of this opinion no one can be better
> acquainted with than myself,” Hamilton emphasized, “but it is not the less
> mischievous for being false.” On March 4 Washington sent Hamilton a
> thoughtful response and disclosed grave premonitions about the crisis. “It
> has been the subject of many contemplative hours,” he told Hamilton. “The
> sufferings of a complaining army, on one hand, and the inability of Congress
> and tardiness of the states on the other, are the forebodings of evil.” He
> voiced concern at America's financial plight and told of his periodic
> frustration at being excluded from congressional decisions. If Congress
> didn't receive enlarged powers, he maintained, revolutionary blood would
> have been spilled in vain. After spelling out areas of agreement with
> Hamilton, however, Washington said he refused to deviate from the “steady
> line of conduct” he had pursued and insisted that the “sensible and
> discerning” officers would listen to reason. He also asserted that any
> attempt to exploit officer discontent might only “excite jealousy and bring
> on its concomitants.” It was a noble letter: Washington refused to pander to
> any political agenda, even one he agreed with, and he would never encroach
> upon the civilian prerogatives of Congress. In a later letter Washington was
> even blunter with Hamilton, warning him that soldiers weren't “mere puppets”
> and that the army was “a dangerous instrument to play with.”  The officers
> continued to believe that Philadelphia politicians remained deaf to their
> pleas, and Washington had no inkling that they would soon resort to more
> muscular measures. In his general orders for March 10, he dwelt on a mundane
> topic, the need for uniform haircuts among the troops. Then he learned of an
> anonymous paper percolating through the camp, summoning officers to a mass
> meeting the next day to air their grievances—a brazen affront to
> Washington's authority and, to his mind, little short of outright
> mutiny. Then a second paper made the rounds, further stoking a sense of
> injustice. Its anonymous author was, in all likelihood, John Armstrong, Jr.,
> an aide-de-camp to Horatio Gates, who mocked the peaceful petitions drawn up
> by the officers and warned that, come peace, they might “grow old in
> poverty, wretchedness, and contempt.” Before being stripped of their weapons
> by an armistice, they should now take direct action: “Change the milk and
> water style of your last memorial—assume a bolder tone . . . And suspect the

## Dental decay

Ever wonder why no one smiled for the camera back then?

> We can deduce that Washington's dental transplant miscarried, since by the

> tooth remaining.



## Foreign Policy

> His skepticism about French motives would harden into a corner-stone of his
> foreign policy. His fellow citizens, he thought, were too ready to glorify
> France, which had entered the war to damage Britain, not to aid the
> Americans. “Men are very apt to run into extremes,” he warned Henry
> Laurens. “Hatred to England may carry some into an excess of confidence in
> France, especially when motives of gratitude are thrown into the scale.”
> John Adams summed up the situation memorably when he said that the French
> foreign minister kept “his hand under our chin to prevent us from drowning,
> but not to lift our heads out of water.” In yet another sign of his growing
> political acumen, Washington generalized this perception into an enduring
> truth of foreign policy, noting that “it is a maxim founded on the universal
> experience of mankind that no nation is to be trusted farther than it is
> bound by its interest.”

> Because the states had refused to collect their quota of taxes, Morris
> couldn't service the sizable debt raised to finance the war. He warned that
> creditors “who trusted us in the hour of distress are defrauded” and that it
> was pure “madness” to “expect that foreigners will trust a government which
> has no credit with its own citizens.”

> While Washington grew increasingly apprehensive about the violent events in
> Paris, Jefferson viewed them with philosophical serenity, lecturing
> Lafayette that one couldn't travel “from despotism to liberty in a
> feather-bed.”

> In August 1792, to Lafayette's horror, the Jacobins incited a popular
> insurrection that included the storming of the Tuileries in Paris and the
> butchery of the Swiss Guards defending the palace. The king was abruptly
> dethroned. Refusing to swear an oath of allegiance to the civil
> constitution, nearly 25,000 priests fled the country amid a horrifying wave
> of anticlerical violence. A month later Parisian mobs engineered the
> September Massacres, slaughtering more than fourteen hundred prisoners, many
> of them aristocrats or royalist priests. Ejected from his military command
> and charged with treason, Lafayette fled to Belgium. “What safety is there
> in a country where Robespierre is a sage, Danton is an honest man, and Marat
> a God?” he wondered. Arrested by Austrian forces, he spent the next five
> years languishing in ghastly Prussian and Austrian prisons. With cruel
> irony, he was charged with having clapped the French king in irons and kept
> him in captivity. While claiming the rights of an honorary American citizen,
> Lafayette was confined in a small, filthy, vermin-infested cell.


> On January 21, 1793, the former King Louis XVI, who had helped win American

> Tacitly railing against Republican support for France, he expounded a

> “The nation which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or an
> habitual fondness, is in some degree a slave.” Sympathy with a foreign
> nation for purely ideological reasons, he said, could lead America into “the
> quarrels and wars of the latter without adequate inducement or
> justification.” He clearly had Jefferson and Madison in mind as he took
> issue with “ambitious, corrupted or deluded citizens (who devote themselves
> to the favorite nation)” and “sacrifice the interests of their own country.”
> Restating his neutrality policy, he underlined the desirability of
> commercial rather than political ties with other nations: “ 'Tis our true

> message.





## Behavior

> While Washington cultivated friendships throughout his life, he didn't have
> many true intimates and his relationships were seldom of the candid or
> confessional type. His reserve, if not impenetrable, was by no means lightly
> surrendered. He was habitually cautious with new people and only gradually
> opened up as they passed a series of loyalty tests. “Be courteous to all but
> intimate with few,” he advised his nephew, “and let those few be well tried
> before you give them your confidence. True friendship is a plant of slow
> growth.”

> In trying to form himself as an English country gentleman, the self-invented
> young Washington practiced the classic strategy of outsiders:  he studied
> closely his social betters and tried to imitate their behavior in polite
> society. Whether to improve his penmanship or perhaps as a school
> assignment, he submitted to the drudgery of copying out 110 social maxims
> from The Rules of Civility and Decent Behavior in Company and Conversation,

> Washington believed that ambitious men should hide their true selves,
> retreat into silence, and not tip people off to their ambition. To sound out
> people, you had to feign indifference and proceed only when convinced that
> they were sympathetic and like-minded. The objective was to learn the
> maximum about other people's thoughts while revealing the minimum about your
> own. Always fearful of failure, Washington wanted to push ahead only if he
> was armed with detailed knowledge and enjoyed a high likelihood of
> success. This cautious, disciplined political style would persist long after
> the original insecurity that had prompted it had disappeared.

> The taciturn Washington wasn't the kind of glib burgess who sprang to his
> feet and orated extemporaneously. He practiced a minimalist art in politics,
> learning how to exert maximum leverage with the least force. Thomas
> Jefferson, who was to serve with Washington and Franklin in the Continental
> Congress, spotted their economical approach to power. “I never heard either
> of them speak ten minutes at a time, nor to any but the main point,” he
> later said of the two statesmen. “They laid their shoulders to the great
> points, knowing that the little ones would follow of themselves.” Later on
> Washington coached his stepson on how to be a Virginia legislator, reminding
> him to be punctual in attendance and “hear dispassionately and determine
> coolly all great questions.”



## Relationship with his mother Mary Washington

> There would always be a cool, quiet antagonism between Washington and his
> mother. The hypercritical mother produced a son who was overly sensitive to
> criticism and suffered from a lifelong need for approval. One suspects that,
> in dealing with this querulous woman, George became an overly controlled

In modern psych, Washington's mother had
[histrionic personality disorder](http://psychcentral.com/disorders/histrionic-personality-disorder-symptoms/).
Everything was always about her and she was always acting out to get the
attention and sympathy of others.

Not happy that little George had another lady in his life.


## Random

When the British surrendered New York City back to the Americans, one
anonymous British officer was still gathering his belongings after the British
had departed, and he noted that the Americans were peacefully reentering the
city compared to the relatively less peaceful camp-life during the British
occupation.  He noted:

> The Americans are a curious, original people. They know how to govern
> themselves, but nobody else can govern them.


> Unable to tell a lie, Washington admitted in his diary that he had “cut down
> the two cherry trees in the courtyard.”

That's where that saying comes from.  This was from his own courtyard once the
Mount Vernon property was his; not when he was a child.



> In addition to his better-known title of Father of His Country, Washington
> is also revered in certain circles as the Father of the American Mule.

Washington always sought to experiment in better agricultural methods and more
hardy livestock.



On Thomas Jefferson's often duplicitous actions:

> The letter gave the world a peek into a very different Thomas Jefferson:
> not the political savant but the crafty, partisan operative marked by
> unrelenting zeal.

> Prior to leaving New York, Washington also
> [signed a proclamation][proclamation] for the first Thanksgiving on November
> 26, declaring that “Almighty God” should be thanked for the abundant
> blessings bestowed on the American people, including victory in the war
> against England, creation of the Constitution, establishment of the new
> government, and the “tranquillity, union, and plenty” that the country now
> enjoyed.

While Washington set the date for one of the first Thanksgiving celebrations,
it was not until
[Lincoln](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving_(United_States)) that it
became an official federal holiday.

  [proclamation]: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/28/thanksgiving-proclamation_n_4078958.html

> Joined at last by Dr. Brown, they took two more pints from Washington's
> depleted body. It has been estimated that Washington surrendered five pints
> of blood altogether, or about half of his body's total supply.

Washington would have died either way from his upper respiratory infection,
but the multiple rounds of blood letting sure
[hastened things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington#Death).
