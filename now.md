I'm constantly needing to refocus and reprioritize.  My daily/weekly todo list
is tactical, but here is where I try to plan out the high level areas of
focus.

* Neurosurgery Residency - first year, learning the basics
* Research: cranioplasty timing and complications, laser ablation, cortical screws in spine
* Family. Learning to be a better husband, brother, and son.
* Exercise & eating well.  Putting life habits into place.
