I'm constantly needing to refocus and reprioritize.  My daily/weekly todo list
is tactical, but here is where I try to plan out the high level areas of
focus.

* Medical school - fourth year, applying to neurosurgery
* Research: cranioplasty timing and complications, laser ablation
* Family. Learning to be a better husband, brother, and son.
* Exercise & eating well.  Putting life habits into place.
