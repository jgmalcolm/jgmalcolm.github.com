I'm constantly needing to refocus and reprioritize.  My daily/weekly todo list
is tactical, but here is where I try to plan out the high level areas of
focus.

* Medical school [clerkship] rotations
* Research: cranioplasty timing and complications
* [Pharm450] - cartoon sketch tutorials to learn pharmacology faster
* Family.  Learning to be a better husband, brother, and son.
* Exercise & eating well.  Putting life habits into place.
