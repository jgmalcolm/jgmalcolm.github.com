Growing up is an undefined process.

I think that growing up means developing your prioritization skills, defining
priorities and then executing in line with those priorities.

Becoming an executive at a small, fast growing startup is all about learning
to prioritize, execute, and measure.  If your situation is not overwhelming,
then you're probably not in a fast growing market.
