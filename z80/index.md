# Beginner
- [Number Bases](beginner/numb.htm) - Learn how to understand and convert
  between the different number systems such as binary and hexadecimal. Make
  your calculator do all the work.
- [z80 Processor](beginner/z80p.htm) - History and specifications of the z80
  processor. What's really behind the games.
- [TI86 Specs](beginner/ti86.htm) - Basic information about the TI86 and its
  ROM versions. Also some info on the LCD.
- [Format and Compiling](beginner/form.htm) - Start coding. Get the necessary
  tools to get you on your way. Walk through creating your very first program
  and running it.
- [Oh, No! It Crashed!](beginner/ohno.htm) - What to do when it freezes up on
  you. A step-by-step diagnosis.
- [TI-BASIC versus Asm](beginner/ti-b.htm) - A simple chart to show you
  equivalent tasks in z80 asm and the old TI-BASIC.
- [Aliases](beginner/alia.htm) - Equates and include files. Download the
  hottest include files around. Make your own equates.
- [Registers](beginner/regi.htm) - How to store and manipulate values.
- [Instructions](beginner/inst.htm) - Start working up your own
  programs. Learn the basic syntax of assembler instructions. A great place to
  reference all those little mnemonics and what they do.
- [Flags and Conditions](beginner/flag.htm) - <CODE>If</CODE> statements.
- [Math](beginner/math.htm) - Learn the basics of simple math routines like
  multiplying, dividing, adding, and subtracting.
- [Two's Compliment](beginner/twos.htm) - Negative numbers and how to use
  them.

# Intermediate
- [Logical Operators](intermediate/logi.htm) - Introduction to
  <CODE>and</CODE>, <CODE>or</CODE>, and <CODE>xor</CODE>. How to mask out
  bits and control binary data.
- [Miscellaneous Instructions](intermediate/misc.htm) - These don't fit in
  anywhere? <CODE>Neg</CODE>, <CODE>scf</CODE>, and others!
- [Graphics](intermediate/grap.htm) - Your one stop reference for pixel
  manipulation and sprite animation. Line-by-line walk throughs of the most
  popular graphics routines.
- [All the Flags](intermediate/allt.htm) - Besides the zero and carry flags,
  there are four others! What do they all do? Come find out!
- [Restart Commands](intermediate/rstc.htm) - Faster <CODE>call</CODE>s with
  the help of these one byte instructions used for some of the most frequent
  ROM calls.
- [Memory and Pages of It](intermediate/memo.htm) - Literally delve into the
  memory of your calculator. What is Consecutive Addressing and how to
  reference addresses in memory. Explore some safe areas to store data at!
- [Variables](intermediate/vari.htm) - Start off storing user input and data
  like high scores and such.
- [The Stack](intermediate/stac.htm) - Ever heard of \"Last On, First Off\"?
  Save register pairs and recall their values later with <CODE>push</CODE> and
  <CODE>pop</CODE>!
- [Tables and Arrays](intermediate/tabl.htm) - The famous <CODE>For</CODE>
  loop used in recursion. Take advantage of the <CODE>ix</CODE> and
  <CODE>iy</CODE> register pairs for lists with an intro into matrices!
- [Simulated 16-bit Addition](intermediate/simu.htm) - A faster method of
  adding <CODE>a</CODE> to <CODE>hl</CODE>. In time crunch areas, this beats
  conventional methods.
- [Random Numbers](intermediate/rand.htm) - Need a random number? This is the
  place for you! Take your pick of several different routines, all designed to
  give you a different number each time.
- [TI's ROM Calls](intermediate/romc.htm) - Why draw up your own routine when
  TI's already got a ton. Use their calls for printing text, checking
  keypresses, clearing the screen, and much much more!
- [Getkey](intermediate/_getkey.htm) - Get user input in a flash with
  <CODE>_GetKey</CODE>! This routine gives you the ability to respond to
  certain key presses. Here you'll find charts filled with key press codes
  with their equates, a handy reference!
- [Text Display](intermediate/text.htm) - Print text on the screen in an
  instant with your choice of several routines printing everything from
  individual characters to entire paragraphs. Learn how to print in standard
  or small text with a look at how to create your own
  [custom fonts](advanced/font.htm).
- [TI-BASIC versus Asm](intermediate/ti-b.htm) - A simple chart to show you
  equivalent tasks in z80 asm and the old TI-BASIC.
