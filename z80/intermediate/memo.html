<H2><A NAME=memo></A>Memory</H2>
Did you know that your TI86 has over 384
kilobytes of memory on it? 98 kilobytes of that is all that
TI-OS lets you store stuff to.

<P>If you already know what calculator memory is, then
skip down to the <A HREF="#rom">ROM</A> and <A HREF="#ram">RAM</A>
sections.

<P>Picture a tape measure. It's one long continuous length of
metal with markings for every centimeter (cm). Memory is sort of
like that. It is continuous and marked off. A tape measure marks
off cm's just as memory marks off bytes. Just like
you could say an object is 3 cm away from another, you could say
a byte is 3 bytes from the start of memory (<CODE>$0000</CODE>).

<P>You really wouldn't be saying "a byte is 3 bytes from the start";
you would just say it's at address <CODE>$0003</CODE>. The 6th byte
in memory is at address <CODE>$0006</CODE>.

<P>Addresses are always given in
<A HREF="../beginner/numb#hex">hexadecimal</A>. It seems
awkward to tell someone an address as <CODE>22322</CODE> compared
to the easier <CODE>$5732</CODE>. There are fewer digits to
remember.



<H2><A NAME=rom></A>ROM</H2>
Read Only Memory (ROM) can only be read from. You can't write
(record) any data to it.

<P>TI-OS is residing in the ROM from address <CODE>$0000</CODE>
to address <CODE>$7fff</CODE>



<H2><A NAME=ram></A>RAM</H2>
Random Access Memory (RAM) is free for you to mess with.

<P>Since the TI86 has so much memory and you can only access
64k at a time using a word address pointer, TI used a system
of addressing using three registers for addressing. <CODE>Ahl</CODE> and
<CODE>BDE</CODE> are two groupings used to address memory. Instead of the
standard $3ad9 to address something, you have an extra byte
to give $023ad9. That way you are able to access more memory
as explained in the <A HREF="../variables/abso">Absolute
Addressing Section</A>.

<P>Another method developed to access more memory is changing
out 'pages' of memory. TI has several memory pages that can
be swapped interchangeably to access different routines. This
method is faster than using the un-natural three byte
<A HREF="../variables/abso">addressing</A>
($000000). These pages are loaded into the memory of the TI86
by different routines for temporary use. They are put between
$010000 and $02bfff for RAM pages and between $02c000 and $05ffff
for ROM pages. This whole system of swapping out pages is called
Asynchronous Serial Communications Interface. The ROM port is port
5 and the RAM port is port 6.

<P>The most frequent <A HREF="romc">ROM calls</A> are to page $0d which then will
swap in whichever memory page needed, execute the routine on that
page, and return the pages to how they were before execution.
You won't have to worry too much about memory pages unless you
are accessing variables on the TI86.

<P>A better way of understanding this is to think of old computers for
a second. Most of them didn't have large hard drives but
instead had the programs on disk. The old games like King's
Quest had three or four disks to switch around to play a game on
top of all the data you pre-loaded onto the hard drive. There
wasn't enough memory to load the whole game onto the hard
drive at once. That is how the TI86's memory is, with 16 ROM
pages, all numbered. You don't use page 0. There are different pages,
or disks as in King's Quest, that take turns being switched
around. Say you wanted to switch to ROM page 3. To switch to
it, your program needs to execute the following lines of code:

<PRE>rom_page_number	=$0d		;page number to switch to
rom_page_port	=5		;port controlling rom page
	ld a,rom_page_number	;page number in a
	out (rom_page_port),a	;tell ti-os to switch to ROM page in a</PRE>

<P>That will put you on ROM
page $0d where many calls are such as _clrLCD. If you make
a call to a page memory address and the page you are thinking
about is not swapped in, your program will probably crash since
the routine you want isn't where you think it is.

<P>TI changes their
<A HREF="../beginner/ti86">ROM versions</A> among their
calculators. To keep up with those ROM versions and call
addresses, they use ROM page $0d as a reference to all the
common calls. You usually call the routine which is located
at the same location on ROM page $0d in all versions. At
that address, it jumps to where the call is located in that
certain ROM version. This helps TI keep the same addresses
for ROM calls between every version. The call address will
always be the same on ROM page $0d but the reference from
there may be different. My program
<A HREF="../download/memsee.asm">MemSee.asm</A> shows
how to swap in any ROM page you want and still call
routines on page $0d safely.

<P>The TI86 has four pages in memory, each of 16 kilobytes. There
are two pages that are static (you cannot switch them) and
two that are dynamic (you can switch them).

<P>When TI-OS runs a program. It automatically swaps in RAM
page 1 for use.

<P>There is something that you must understand when working
with ports: You can swap in a ROM page or a RAM page into
the same memory area. The only difference between requesting
a ROM page versus a RAM page is whether or not
<A HREF="../beginner/numb#bitp">bit 6</A> of <CODE>a</CODE> is set
or reset. If bit 6 is set, then the TI86 swaps in a RAM page;
if is reset, it swaps in a ROM page. Here's two routines,
they require upon entry that <CODE>a</CODE> is the requested page. To
change in a ROM page between address $4000 and $7fff, call
'swap_ROM'; to swap in a RAM page between addresses $8000 and
$bfff, call 'swap_RAM'. The code swaps in ROM page $0a
and RAM page $07 (the <A HREF="../variables/vats">Variable
Allocation Table</A>) and quits.

<PRE>desired_ROM	=$0a	;ROM page we want to swap in
desired_RAM	=$07	;RAM page we want to swap in
ROM_port	=5	;ROM port
RAM_port	=6	;RAM port
	ld a,desired_ROM
	call swap_ROM
	ld a,desired_RAM
			;walk right into the routine
			; to swap in desired RAM page
swap_RAM:
	ld c,RAM_port	;port to work with
	and $07		;can't have a value greater
			; than $07 because there
			; aren't that many RAM pages
	set 6,a		;tell ti-os it's a RAM page
			; that you want
	out (c),a	;load that page
	ret
swap_ROM:
	ld c,ROM_port	;port to work with
	and $0f		;can't have a value greater
			; than $0f because there
			; aren't that many ROM pages

<H2><A NAME=safe></A>Safe Areas</H2>
The following chart shows
some frequently used data areas where you can store stuff
temporarily during program
execution. The <A HREF="vari">Variables Section</A> goes
into much more detail on this.

<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER class="function">
	<TR CLASS=header>
		<TD><A NAME=safe></A>Start Address
		<TD>Size in bytes
		<TD ALIGN=CENTER>Use
	<TR>	<TD>$???? to $fa70
		<TD>????
		<TD>You can store temporary variables after the end
		of your program. Your
		program is given a space of about 10k to use when it's run. When you run the
		program, TI-OS copies your entire program to
		<CODE>_asm_exec_ram=$d748</CODE>. From
		there you can store until but you reach the address
		<CODE>$fa70</CODE> (which is used for
		one of the stack systems...don't mess with it). This area is zeroed once a new
		program is run, so this is only temporary.<BR><BR>
		Example: <A HREF="../download/tempmemo.asm">tempmemo.asm</A> |
		<A HREF="../download/tempmemo.86p">tempmemo.86p</A>
	<TR>	<TD>$c0f9
		<TD>168
		<TD><CODE>_textShadow</CODE>. This is one of the most
		useful places to store variables, which we will talk
		about later, because it's not used by the calculator
		during your program's execution.
		<P>TI-OS will store the values of the large text
		written to the screen in this area. To stop it from
		doing this, execute the following:</FONT>
		<PRE>	res appTextSave,(IY+appflags)</PRE>
		When you are done with your program, execute the
		following to clear this memory so you don't have a
		bunch of junk on your screen:</FONT>
		<PRE>	set appTextSave,(IY+appflags)
	call _clrScrn
	<TR>	<TD>$c9fa
		<TD>1024
		<TD><CODE>_plotSScreen</CODE>. Another useful place to
		store variables or images during program execution. When
		you exit though, this is not cleared so TI-OS will graph
		a bunch of garbage next time the user goes to the graph.
		To avoid this just put:</FONT>
		<PRE>	set graphdraw,(IY+graphflags)</PRE>
		That will tell the TI86 that it needs to clear the graph
		next time the user accesses it.
	<TR>	<TD>$fc00
		<TD>1024
		<TD>This is where the <A HREF="scre">LCD</A> is
		and where the pixels you <A HREF="pixe">draw</A> are displayed. Each byte
		stands for 8 pixels, meaning that each bit stands for a
		pixel black (set) or white (reset). Each row is 16 bytes.
		This will be explained later in more detail but you shouldn't
		use this area unless you have to.
	<TR>	<TD>$8100 to $bfff
		<TD>~16k
		<TD>RAM PAGE 1. This page is used for two things by TI-OS: Floating
		Point Stack and Operator Stack. They start their storage space at
		opposite ends of the page and work thier way to the center. Because of
		these sensitive areas, start storing from atleast $8100 instead of
		$8000 because the floating point stack usually has one or two items
		pushed to it, like your program's name. If your program uses the
		Floating Point Stack then you may want to start even later.
