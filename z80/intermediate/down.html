<P CLASS=clsByLine>Written by <A HREF="mailto:mja@algonet.se">Jimmy M&aring;rdell</A></P>

<P>I've made some research on what causes the famous down-left freeze bug
(or is it a feature!?) and how to get around it when programming. I hope
some programmers find this information useful - the routines below is at
least used in the upcoming <I>Sqrxz 1.0</I>.

<P>So - how do you do to avoid the freeze bug? I've found three majorways
to solve the problem:

<UL>
	<LI><A HREF=#disable>Disable Interrupts</A>
	<LI><A HREF=#set><CODE>set 2,(iy+$12)</CODE></A>
	<LI><A HREF=#crea>Creating your own interrupt handler</A>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME=disable></A>Disabling interrupts</H2>

<P>In most games, this method is enough to avoid the problems. There are
two disadvantages doing it this way though. Those are:

<OL>
	<LI>Keypresses must be read through ports
	<LI>You can't create your own interrupt handlers
</OL>

<P>The first disadvantage is not much of a problem, most of the time. And
the second disadvantage is usually not a problem either. But sometimes
you want stuff to go on in the background (a timer for example) and then
disabling interrupts is not a good way to prevent the down-left bug.



<H2><A NAME=set></A>Setting Flags</H2>

<P>When disassembling the ROM I found that if the second bit at <CODE>(iy+$12)</CODE>
is set, there will be no call to the routine that check
<A HREF="../advanced/allp.htm#p1">Port 1</A> for keypresses.
That routine lies at <CODE>$01a1</CODE>, and if that routine is not called, the Down-Left
Bug is gone. This is also a very simple way to get around the problem,
but it still has the disadvantage that you have to read keypresses through
ports. And most of the time when method 1 (<A HREF="#disable">Disabling interrupts</A>) isn't
enough, it usually means you want to make your own interrupt handler, and
then method 3 is best suited for it (<A HREF=#crea>Your Handler</A>). If you use this method,
you <I>must</I> reset the flag with <CODE>res 2,(iy+$12)</CODE> before the program terminates
- else the calc <A HREF="../beginner/ohno.htm">freezes</A>.



<H2><A NAME=crea></A>Creating Your Own Interrupt Handler</H2>

<P>This is the most complex method, which I had some problems with first.
Creating an interrupt handler is not much of a problem really. This is
easily done with the following code:

<PRE>	ld hl,$8e00
	ld de,$8e01
	ld (hl),$8f
	ld bc,256
	ldir
	ld hl,inthandler
	ld de,$8f8f
	ld bc,intend-inthandler
	ldir
	ld a,$8e
	ld i,a
	im 2</PRE>

<P>This code stores a vector table at <CODE>$8e00-$8f00</CODE> and the interrupt handler
at <CODE>$8f8f</CODE>. Since most of RAM Page 1 is free to use, this seems to
work without problems. The interrupt handler could then look something
like:

<PRE>inthandler:
	ex af,af'
	exx

	. . .
	. . .	;interrupt code
	. . .

	ex af,af'
	exx
	jp $38
intend:</PRE>

<P>This method is used in <I>Sqrxz 0.9</I>. The problem is that each interrupt ends
with a jump to the default interrupt at <CODE>$38</CODE> - which has the Down-Left Bug.
So, I tried to replace <CODE>jp $38</CODE> with <CODE>ei / reti</CODE> (which is how the default
interrupt handler ends) but that didn't work - The calc <A HREF="../beginner/ohno.htm">crashed</A> :( To find
out what was wrong, I had to play around with the default interrupt handler.
Anyway, this is how a "homemade" interrupt handler should look like, that
doesn't use the buggy handler in the ROM AND still uses ROM routines for
reading keys (without having the Down-Left Bug):

<PRE>inthandler:
	ex af,af'
	exx

	. . .
	. . .	;interrupt code
	. . .

	in a,(3)
	rra
	push af		; This three lines are not needed
	call nc,$01a1	; if you only read keys through ports
	pop af
	ld a,9
	adc a,$00
	out (3),a
	ld a,$0b
	out (3),a
	ex af,af'
	exx
	ei
	reti
intend:</PRE>

<P>It's necessary to send <CODE>$09 $0b</CODE> to <A HREF="../advanced/allp.htm#p3">Port 3</A>
when [ON] is <I>not</I> pressed and when
[ON] is pressed, you have to send <CODE>$0a $0b</CODE> to Port 3 - else the calc crashes.
This method works very well - it allows the user to create his own interrupt
handler and still use the ROM routines to convert Port 1 (Key Port) bit code to scancodes
without having the annoying Down-Left Bug.
