<P>Find Pixel is a small routine that sets the basis for plotting pixels on the
screen. It takes the x and y coordinates of where you want to put a pixel and transforms
those coordinates into an address and a bit offset. The address it gives you is
for the byte that that pixel coordinate is in the Video Memory.

<P>Some routines give you
this address relative to zero being the top left of the screen. You might have to add
$fc00 to the address outputted in order to get the exact address in the Video Memory. The
bit offset is stored as a bit set in the accumulator (<CODE>a</CODE>
<A HREF="../beginner/regi.htm">register</A>). The bit
cooresponds to the pixel you want. If you set the same bit in <CODE>a</CODE> as the address in
the video memory given by <CODE>hl</CODE>, you will have a little black dot at the coordinates
you want on the screen. Most routines accept the x coordinate in <CODE>b</CODE> and the y
coordinate in <CODE>c</CODE>.

<P>I've pasted <A HREF="mailto:darkclem@wanadoo.fr">Clem Vasseur's</A>
<A HREF="../download/findpixel.asm">FindPixel.asm</A> Routine here. You
can <A HREF="../download/findpixel.zip">download</A> this along with
many other Find Pixel routines that I've come across in the
<A HREF="../download/download.htm">Download Section</A>. Each
line in the routine is represented by a number which corresponds
to an explanation at the end of the routine. Follow each line and
try to picture in your head what it is doing.

	<TR>
		<TD><A HREF="#c2" NAME="l2">&uarr;</A>2
		<TD>This routine is great because it knows
		we are going to want the address relative to the Video Memory
		($fc00) and not relative to zero ($0000). We are going to
		be multiplying <CODE>hl</CODE> times 4. We can think ahead and
		see that 63*4 converted to hexadecimal is $fc. That's the
		Most Significant Byte (MSB) of what we want. This will
		handle for us the adding of the final address to $fc00. The
		multiplying by 4 will come in lines <A HREF="#c9">9</A> and
		<A HREF="#c11">11</A>.
		<TD>2
	<TR>
		<TD><A HREF="#c3" NAME="l3">&uarr;</A>3
		<TD>We need to get the y coordinate and multiply
		it by 16 (or 2<sup>4</sup>) so we move down 16 bytes (one row)
		until we're at the row designated by the y coordinate. We can't
		just do 16*<CODE>c</CODE>. We can square the y coordinate 4 times so
		we have it times 16. We are going to use 'add a,a' for the first 2
		squares because we know we won't exceed 256 with just 2 multiplies
		since the maximum y value is 64 (64*2*2=256). 'Add a,a' is over
		two times faster than 'add hl,hl' which we will have to use
		later.
		<TD>1
	<TR>
		<TD><A HREF="#c4" NAME="l4">&uarr;</A>4-5
		<TD>Now we've got to start multiplying the
		y coordinate (which was in <CODE>c</CODE>) by 16. It's nice that
		the screen is 16 bytes across because that way it's a power
		of 2 so we can figure this stuff out fast with just shifting
		bits over to the right once.
		<TD>2
	<TR>
		<TD><A HREF="#c6" NAME="l6">&uarr;</A>6
		<TD>We put what we've just got into the Least
		Significant Byte (LSB) of our final address to be stored in
		<CODE>hl</CODE>.
		<TD>1
	<TR>
		<TD><A HREF="#c7" NAME="l7">&uarr;</A>7
		<TD>Now's time to start working with the
		x coordinate stored in <CODE>b</CODE>. Since it's in terms of
		pixels (or bits in each pixel) we need to think of each
		byte containing 8 pixels. We need to divide the x coordinate
		by 8 to account for each of the 8 pixels in a byte.
		<TD>1
	<TR>
		<TD><A HREF="#c8" NAME="l8">&uarr;</A>8
		<TD>If this is unfamiliar to you, refer to the
		<A HREF="../advanced/shif.htm">Shift and Rotate Section</A> to
		get a quick lesson. It rotates the bits one to the right with
		bit 0 being moved to bit 7 and also copied into the carry
		flag. This also acts as dividing by 2 since we shift over by a
		power of 2 (2<sup>1</sup>=2). This is the same as lines
		<A HREF="#c10">10</A> and <A HREF="#c12">12</A>.
		<TD>1
	<TR>
		<TD><A HREF="#c9" NAME="l9">&uarr;</A>9
		<TD>We need to perform the third multiplication
		of the y coordinate by 2. This is the same as line
		<A HREF="#c11">11</A>.
		<TD>1

		<TD><A HREF="#c13" NAME="l13">&uarr;</A>13-14
		<TD>This adds in the result we just found with
		whatever is currently in the LSB of <CODE>hl</CODE> (<CODE>l</CODE>). Then
		we put that result into the LSB. We now have the final
		address in the Video Memory in <CODE>hl</CODE> ready to be used.
		<TD>2
	<TR>
		<TD><A HREF="#c15" NAME="l15">&uarr;</A>15
		<TD>Out next task is to figure out the bit offset
		needed in <CODE>a</CODE>. Let's get back out x coordinate from <CODE>b</CODE>
		and work with it again.
		<TD>1
	<TR>
		<TD><A HREF="#c16" NAME="l16">&uarr;</A>16
		<TD>We have already figured out which byte the
		pixel is in. The remainder of after that calculation tells
		us where in that byte. The remainder would be the bits we
		shifted out the right, the last 3 bits (%00000111). If
		the remainder were 3, then we would know that the pixel
		is the 3rd from the left. We want to mask off (get rid of)
		all the bits except for the ones that would be our remainder.
		<TD>2
	<TR>
		<TD><A HREF="#c17" NAME="l17">&uarr;</A>17
		<TD>Lines <A HREF="#c25">25</A> and following are
		a set of precalculated bit offsets. We use that table and
		add the remainder to that to get the correct offset. If the
		remainder were 3, then we would need the
		<A HREF="#c28">3rd element</A> in the table which is %00100000.
		<TD>3
	<TR>
		<TD><A HREF="#c18" NAME="l18">&uarr;</A>18-22
		<TD>This is
		<A HREF="../intermediate/simu.htm">Simulated 16-bit Addition</A>
		which will be covered later in more detail. It's faster than just doing
		<CODE>ld h,0 / ld l,a / add hl,bc</CODE> to get the offset in the table. It
		adds <CODE>a</CODE> to the LSB of <CODE>hl</CODE>, stores the result in the LSB,
		adds the result to the MSB with the carry and subtracts the LSB. The
		MSB is either increased by one (if the carry is set) or remains the
		same (if the carry is reset).
		<TD>5
	<TR>
		<TD><A HREF="#c23" NAME="l23">&uarr;</A>23
		<TD>Put that element of the table into <CODE>a</CODE>.

		<TD>Done with the routine so return to caller.
		<TD>1
	<TR>
		<TD><A HREF="#c25" NAME="l25">&uarr;</A>25-33
		<TD>Here begins a table with all possible bit offsets
		for <CODE>a</CODE>. They are in binary to make it easier for viewing. See
		lines <A HREF="#l15">15</A> and following to see how this is used.
