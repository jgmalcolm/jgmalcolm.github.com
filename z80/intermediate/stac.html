<P>The stack is a part of the
calculator's memory that it uses for calls. When something
is called, the TI86 has to remember where it just came from so
that it can go back. An address is two bytes, a word, and so the
stack is incremented/decremented a word to allow for the
storage or removal of an address.

<P>The stack is like a deck
of cards: You put Card A on, then Card B, and then Card C.
When you go to take them off: first comes Card C, then Card B,
and last Card A. The first one on is the <I>last</I> one off.

<P>Then as you take it off...

	<TR>	<TD>Card B
		<TD style="border: none">

	<TR>	<TD>Card A
</TABLE>

<P>We can use the stack to store values temporarily. This is useful
when you have <CODE>bc</CODE> holding the value of <CODE>$3205</CODE> and you want
to call a function that you know will change the contents of <CODE>bc</CODE>,
so you <CODE>push bc</CODE> onto the stack, call the
function, and <CODE>pop bc</CODE> off the stack.

<P>When you
push something, it is not stored with a label "I belong to <CODE>bc</CODE>".
The value is just there at the top. You can <CODE>pop</CODE> it off as <CODE>hl</CODE>
for all I care, but that might confuse you later. When you push
something, the register still has the value, the value is just
copied to the top of the stack.

<PRE>	ld bc,$0303		;load bc with coordinates (3,3)
		push bc		; want to keep bc so i'm pushing it
	call clear_and_draw	;call 'clear_and_draw' routine
		pop bc		;put the coordinates back in their place
	ret			;exit
clear_and_draw:			;draws bird at (3,4)
	call _clrLCD		;clear screen
	ld bc,$0304		;erase bc, put new coordinates
	call draw_bird		;draw bird at (3,4) on screen
	ret			;go home</PRE>

<P>The same code can be written like this too.  There's no change the the
actual code but the way we load the coordinates is different.  Instead of
having to figure out the coordinates manually and put them in the right
spaces, we can just multiply the first coordinate by 256 so it now
a 16 bit value and is stored in the upper register of <CODE>bc</CODE> which is
<CODE>b</CODE>.  Then we just add the second coordinate which just affects the
bottom register, <CODE>c</CODE>.

<PRE>	ld bc,256*3+3		;load bc with coordinates (3,3)
		push bc		;i  want to keep bc so i'm pushing it
	call clear_and_draw	;call 'clear_and_draw' routine
		pop bc		;put the coordinates back in their place
	ret			;exit
clear_and_draw:			;draws bird at (3,4)
	call _clrLCD		;clear screen
	ld bc,3*256+4		;erase bc, put new coordinates
	call draw_bird		;draw bird at (3,4) on screen
	ret			;go home</PRE>

<P>The functionality of this is better used
with the
<A HREF="text#vari">variable width</A> (small) font where you have coordinates that are
large hexadecimal numbers.  The following loads the variable cursor
position with (25,48) which would be ($19,$30) in hexadecimal.

<PRE>	ld bc,256*48+25		;load the text coordinates 25,48
				;across 25 and down 48
	ld (_penCol),bc		;load up the coordinates for the cursor</PRE>

<P>You can also use <A HREF="../advanced/asse#defi">define</A> to
make it even easier.

<PRE>#define coords(x,y)	ld hl,256*y+x / ld (_penCol),hl

	coords(5,24)
	ld hl,text_to_print
	jp _vputs

text_to_print:	.db "stupid",0</PRE>
