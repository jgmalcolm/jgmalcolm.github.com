<P>This is a quick reference for you to look up what the call <CODE>_getkey</CODE>
returns. <CODE>_Getkey</CODE> waits for a keypress and stores that key press
into <CODE>a</CODE>. It handles user input for increasing contrast and breaking programs.
It is not very useful for breaking out of assembly programs because it doesn't
always work. Once <CODE>_getkey</CODE> is done, it has changed <CODE>a, de</CODE>,
and <CODE>hl</CODE> from what they were originally.

<P>All of these keys are <A HREF="../advanced/asse.htm#defi">defined</A> in the include
file <A HREF="../download/ti86asm.inc"><CODE>ti86asm.inc</CODE></A> contained in
<A HREF="../download/includes.zip">includes.zip</A>. If you
<A HREF="../advanced/asse.htm#incl">include</A> <CODE>ti86asm.inc</CODE>
in your source file, you will be able to reference these keys by these
names. This chart is really unnecessary except for a quick reference for spellings
and group associations.

<P>There are several repeated key codes, such as <CODE>kLeft</CODE>. It is on three
of these four tables. The TI86 treats it the same for each of these
cases. If you were to have the [ALPHA] key hit (so we're in the Alpha Function)
and were to hit [Left], the scancode <CODE>$02</CODE> would be returned by
<CODE>_getkey</CODE>. If you were to have hit [2nd],[ALPHA] instead of
[ALPHA], it would have returned <CODE>$02</CODE> also. These both mean the
same thing to TI-OS.

<P>Some keys that aren't clearly defined by their equate name are as follows:
<CODE>kChs</CODE> is [(-)](the negate sign), <CODE>kNext</CODE> is [MORE],
<CODE>kBOL</CODE> means that the user wants to go to the beginning of
the line, <CODE>kEOL</CODE> means that the user wants to go to
the end of the line, and <CODE>kInv</CODE> is the reciprocal key above [EE].

<P>You can download the program <A HREF="../download/keytest.asm">keytest.asm</A>
to see which key codes are returned for which keys instead of just looking at these
charts. It's easier to use the program to find the keycodes for a key which you
know where it is on the keypad compared to looking it up on these tables.

<P>When you're in a program such as <A HREF="../download/rascall.zip">Rascall</A>,
you can scroll through the programs by hitting the arrow keys one at a time, or you
can hold the arrow keys down to make it scroll through the choices real fast. This
is called Key Repeat. <CODE>_Getkey</CODE> monitors if a key is being held
down and returns that keycode as soon as the routine is called instead of polling
for key presses all over again. <CODE>_Getkey</CODE> does this by checking the
status of the <A HREF="../advanced/allt.htm#p0">Key Press</A> port (Port 0)
to what it was last time <CODE>_getkey</CODE> was called. If it is the same,
it will return the same keycode that it got before. This, however, can
be disrupted when you use other ports, like to change <A HREF="memo.htm#ROM">ROM
pages</A>.

<P>Here's an example of how to use <CODE>_getkey</CODE> to find out when [ENTER] was
pressed. Remember that <CODE>_getkey</CODE> won't return to your program until
a key is pressed, any key, including [ON].

<PRE>key_check_loop:
	call _getkey		;wait for a keypress
	cp kEnter		;is a=kEnter
	jr z,enter_was_pressed	;it was...jump somewhere
	jr key_check_loop	;it wasn't...repeat</PRE>
