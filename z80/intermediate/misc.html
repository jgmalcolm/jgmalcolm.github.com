<P>There are four small instructions that are very handy
but I can't really categorize.

<P><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER CLASS=info WIDTH="80%">
	<TR>	<TD><PRE>ccf
		<TD>Compliment Carry Flag - Inverts the carry flag.
	<TR>	<TD><PRE>cpl
		<TD>ComPLiment accumulator - Inverts all bits in <CODE>a</CODE>.  If
		<CODE>a</CODE> was <CODE>%11001111</CODE> then it would now be
		<CODE>%00110000</CODE>.
	<TR>	<TD><PRE>neg</PRE>
		<TD>NEGate accumulator - If <CODE>a</CODE> was
		2 then it's now -2.  See the <A HREF="../beginner/twos.htm">Two's
		Compliment</A> Section.
	<TR>	<TD><PRE>scf</PRE>
		<TD>Set Carry Flag - No real reason but
		just thought I'd tell you.  Maybe use it for return
		conditions on routines, like if there was an error during the
		routine, it would set the accumulator, then the user could see if
		there was an error by checking the carry flag.
	<TR>	<TD><PRE>ldir</PRE>
		<TD>LoaD (<CODE>de</CODE>) with (<CODE>hl</CODE>), Decrement
		<CODE>bc</CODE>, Increment <CODE>de</CODE> and <CODE>hl</CODE>,
		and Repeat until <CODE>bc</CODE> is zero.  It's
		basically a block copy.  It copies <CODE>bc</CODE> size to copy (amount of
		bytes from <CODE>hl</CODE> to <CODE>de</CODE>).<PRE>	ld hl,source_code
	ld de,destination_code
	ld bc,source_code_end-source_code
	ldir
</TABLE>
