<SCRIPT LANGUAGE=JavaScript>top("Intermediate","TI's ROM Calls");</SCRIPT>

<P>I thought about giving detailed descriptions about the uses of different
calls frequently used from TI, but then I remembered that I'm lazy. If you
want to learn, experiment like I did. Maybe I'll teach you some later. Here
are a couple that you'll use a lot. Most of these calls are already
defined in <A HREF="../download/includes.zip"><CODE>ti86asm.inc</CODE></A>. If you don't
use that file and you want to put them in your program you have to define
them somewhere in your program. Say you wanted to use <CODE>_clrLCD</CODE>
in your program, you would have to have the following somewhere in your program
with no leading spaces.

<PRE>	_clrLCD = $4a7e</PRE>

<P>Remember how these calls are used in conjunction with the
<A HREF="../beginner/flag.htm">flags</A>:

<PRE>	call <I>arg1</I>
	call _clrLCD		;clear the screen
	call _homeup		;put cursor at top left
	call z,_homeup
	call nz,_homeup
	call c,_homeup
	call nc,_homeup</PRE>

		<TD>Alias

		<TD>What It Does
	<TR>	<TD><CODE>_clrLCD
		<TD><CODE>$4a7e
		<TD>Clears the screen.
	<TR>	<TD><CODE>_clrScrn
		<TD><CODE>$4a82
		<TD>Clears the screen and sets the <CODE>_textShadow</CODE>
		area all to ' ' (<CODE>LSpace</CODE>).
	<TR>	<TD><CODE>_Exec_Assembly
		<TD><CODE>$5730
		<TD>Execute the assembly program whose name is in
		<A HREF="../variables/ti86.htm">OP1</A> in
		<A HREF="../variables/vari.htm">Variable Name Format</A>.
	<TR>	<TD><CODE>_FlushAllMenus
		<TD><CODE>$49dc
		<TD>Clear all current menus. This allows text to be written
		on the last two rows if menus were running.
	<TR>	<TD><CODE>_getkey
		<TD><CODE>$55aa
		<TD>Returns the value of the last key pressed into <CODE>a</CODE>. You
		need a <A HREF="_getkey.htm">chart</A> to see which key is what.
	<TR>	<TD><CODE>_homeup
		<TD><CODE>$4a95
		<TD>Puts the big cursor's position at the top left of the screen.
	<TR>	<TD><CODE>_move10b
		<TD><CODE>$427b
		<TD>Moves 10 bytes from <CODE>hl</CODE> to <CODE>de</CODE>.
	<TR>	<TD><CODE>_NewLine
		<TD><CODE>$4a5f
		<TD>Execute a carrage return in
		<A HREF="text.htm#curs">cursor font</A>.
	<TR>	<TD><CODE>_PDspGrph
		<TD><CODE>$4d6f
		<TD>Displays the graph screen with the current settings. If you jump
		to this (so you exit right from your program) it will have the graph
		menu at the bottom just as if you had hit [GRAPH] at the homescreen.
	<TR>	<TD><CODE>_putc
		<TD><CODE>$4a2b
		<TD>Puts <CODE>a</CODE>'s ASCII value onto the screen at the current
		cursor position and advances the cursor position. More on this
		in the <A HREF="../intermediate/text.htm">Text Display Routines</A> section.
	<TR>	<TD><CODE>_putmap
		<TD><CODE>$4a27
		<TD>Puts <CODE>a</CODE>'s ASCII value onto the screen at the current
		cursor position but does not advance the cursor position. More on this
		in the <A HREF="../intermediate/text.htm">Text Display Routines</A> section.
	<TR>	<TD><CODE>_putps
		<TD><CODE>$4a3b
		<TD>Puts the length-indexed string pointed to by <CODE>hl</CODE>
		at the current cursor position. More on this
		in the <A HREF="../intermediate/text.htm">Text Display Routines</A> section.
	<TR>	<TD><CODE>_puts
		<TD><CODE>$4a37
		<TD>Puts the zero-terminated string pointed to by <CODE>hl</CODE>
		at the current cursor position. More on this
		in the <A HREF="../intermediate/text.htm">Text Display Routines</A> section.
	<TR>	<TD><CODE>_vputmap
		<TD><CODE>$4aa1
		<TD>Puts <CODE>a</CODE>'s ASCII value onto the screen at the current
		cursor position in menu text and advances the cursor position. More on this
		in the <A HREF="../intermediate/text.htm">Text Display Routines</A> section.
	<TR>	<TD><CODE>_vputs
		<TD><CODE>$4aa5
		<TD>Puts the zero-terminated string pointed to by <CODE>hl</CODE>
		at the current cursor position in menu text. More on this
		in the <A HREF="../intermediate/text.htm">Text Display Routines</A> section.
	<TR>	<TD><A NAME=_runIndicOff><CODE>_runIndicOff
		<TD><CODE>$4ab1
		<TD>Turn off that annoying busy indicator.
	<TR>	<TD><CODE>_runIndicOn
		<TD><CODE>$4aad
		<TD>Turn on that annoying busy indicator.
	<TR>	<TD><CODE>_StoAns
		<TD><CODE>$4c9f
		<TD>Store <A HREF="../variables/ti86.htm">OP1</A> into
		the Answer (Ans) variable. If OP1 is a complex number,
		OP2 will be used as the imaginary part.

<P>Here's a sample program using a few of the above ROM calls.

<PRE>#include "ti86asm.inc"

.org _asm_exec_ram

	call _clrLCD		;clear the screen
	ld hl,(256*23)+7	;load values for the
				; coordinates into hl
				;column 7
				;row 23
	ld (_penCol),hl		;set coordinates in memory
	ld hl,strWaiting	;load pointer to
				; string into hl
	call _vputs		;print string on screen
	call _getkey		;wait for any key to be
				; pressed before continuing
	call _clrLCD		;clear the screen again
	ret			;exit

strWaiting:	.db "Waiting...",0

.end
