<P>All the mathmatical operations you'll
need to start programming can be broken
down into four groups:
<UL>
	<LI><A HREF="#add">Addition</A>
	<LI><A HREF="#sub">Subtraction</A>
	<LI><A HREF="#mult">Multiplication</A>
	<LI><A HREF="#div">Division</A>
</UL>

You can test these and your own math routines
using <A HREF="../download/mathtest.asm">MathTest.asm</A>.
In its current form it only supports the answer
in the 8 bit <A HREF="regi">register</A> <CODE>a</CODE>;
but, you can follow the directions in the comments
to change it to use <CODE>hl</CODE> in 2 seconds.

<P>Remember also that we are only working with integers here.
Floating point math is taken care of in
the <A HREF="../variables/bcd">Binary Coded Decimal</A>
section. You can always write your own routines which
will probably be faster than TI's, but why
reinvent the wheel?

<P>I wouldn't go into any of these routines
if either of your operands is zero. Infinite loops
and bogus answers are sure to follow.

<A NAME="add"></A><H2>Addition</H2>
Seems simple enough, right? You're using the accumulator
(<CODE>a</CODE>) so you load it with one operand and load the other
into another 8 bit <A HREF="regi">register</A>. After you've
got that setup, go ahead and add them. Let's add 4 and 5 to get 9.
Using <CODE>add</CODE>, the result will be stored in <CODE>a</CODE>.

<PRE>	ld a,4	;one operand
	ld b,5	;second operand
	add a,b	;a+b (saved in a)</PRE>

<P>Don't forget the 16 bit registers. You can appply
the same methods to them; but, instead of revolving
around the accumulator (<CODE>a</CODE>), they revolve around
<CODE>hl</CODE>. The advantage of using 16 bit registers
is that you can have way bigger operands.

<PRE>	ld hl,4000	;4,000
	ld de,15000	;15,000
	add hl,de	;4,000+15,000=19,000</PRE>

<P>Things can get a little more complicated when you start
using the <A HREF="flag#carry">carry flag</A>.
The general idea is, add the two operands and, if the carry
flag is set, add one to the answer. Don't add one if
the carry flag was reset.

<P>This is helpful, let's say, if you want to account
for an overflow in the previous calculation. You
have a calculation (
<A HREF="../opcodes/opcodesN#add"><CODE>add</CODE></A>,
<A HREF="../opcodes/opcodesN#sub"><CODE>sub</CODE></A>,
<A HREF="../opcodes/opcodesN#dec"><CODE>dec</CODE></A>,
<A HREF="../opcodes/opcodesN#inc"><CODE>inc</CODE></A>, etc.)
which may or may not have resulted in an answer that was too big
for it to store. The carry flag will be set if so.

<PRE>	ld a,200
	ld b,150
	add a,b		;200+150=350
			; way too big
			; to store in
			; 8 bit register
			;max it can hold
			; is 255
			;carry set!
	ld a,4
	ld b,5
	adc a,b		;4+5=9
			;carry is set
			; so 9+1=10
			;10 is stored in
			; a</PRE>

The practicality of this feature can
be seen in the <A HREF="../intermediate/simu">Simulated 16 bit
Addition</A> section, if you want to get more indepth.


<A NAME="sub"></A><H2>Subtraction</H2>
Similar but opposite,
<A HREF="../opcodes/opcodesN#sub"><CODE>sub</CODE></A>
is used for subtraction. The value you want subtracted <I>from</I>
is loaded into the accumulator (<CODE>a</CODE>), the value you
want to subtract is put into another register, and then you
are ready to perform the actual subtraction.

<PRE>	ld a,5	;one operand
	ld b,4	;second operand
	sub b	;a-b=5-4=1
		;1 stored in a</PRE>

You can get into a mess if you try subtracting a
<I>big</I> number from a <I>little</I> number. You
won't get the answer you expect and the
<A HREF="flag#carry">carry flag</A> will be set.

<PRE>	ld a,4	;one operand
	ld b,5	;second operand
	sub b	;a-b=4-5=-1=255</PRE>

From the <A HREF="twos">Two's Compliment</A> section,
you can see that a value of -1 means the same as
255. You can go ahead and add this to another
8 bit register and it will be the same as
adding -1.

<PRE>	ld c,6
	ld a,4	;one operand
	ld b,5	;second operand
	sub b	;a-b=4-5=-1=255
	add a,c	;a+c=-1+6=5
		;5 is stored in a</PRE>
<A NAME="sbc"></A>
As with <CODE>adc</CODE>, there is <CODE>sbc</CODE>.
It works the same way but adds one to the
number <I>being</I> subtracted if the carry is
set (not the
number subtracted <I>from</I>).

<PRE>	ld a,200
	ld b,150
	add a,b		;200+150=350
			; way too big
			; to store in
			; 8 bit register
			;max it can hold
			; is 255
			;carry set!
	ld a,5
	ld b,3
	sbc a,b		;5-(3+1)=1
			;carry is set
			; so 3+1=4
			; 5-4=1
			;1 is stored in a</PRE>


<A NAME="mult"></A><H2>Multiplication</H2>
If you haven't figured it out yet, there aren't
any <A HREF="../opcodes/opcodes">instructions</A> to
directly multiply. You have to mix some
<CODE>add</CODE>'s, <CODE>sub</CODE>'s,
shifts, and rotates to get what you want.
The first few examples assume
the answer doesn't excede the capacity
of an 8 bit register (255).

<P>You've been through elementary school,
you know how the basics of multiplication:
add repeatedly.

<P>Since it's always better to use code
that <I>you</I> understand, this routine
is about as simple as it gets. <CODE>B</CODE> is one
operand and <CODE>c</CODE> is the other with
the answer in <CODE>a</CODE>

<PRE>	sub a	;zero a
	or b	;is b=0?
	ret z	;exit if b=0 so ret
multiply_loop:
	add a,c	;add c to total so far
	djnz multiply_loop</PRE>

The effect is that <CODE>c</CODE> is repeatedly
added to itself, the very idea of
multiplication in 6 bytes!

<P>There are two drawbacks to this
method.
<OL>
	<LI>The larger the numbers,
	the more loops executed,
	the slower the routine.
	<LI>The answer can't
	excede 255 or there's an
	overflow. You need to use
	16 bit <A HREF="regi">registers</A>.
</OL>

<P>Time is of the essence, you need
a fast routine. You need to multiply
a number (<CODE>x</CODE>) loaded in
<CODE>a</CODE> to a constant--let's
try 2 first. The advantage of
using a constant is that you
don't need loops, it goes through
the code once and only once.
You know exactly how long it's
going to take.

<PRE>	add a,a	;a=a=2*a</PRE>

That simple! Try times 5.

<PRE>	ld b,a	;save it away temporarily
	add a,a	;a*2
	add a,a	;a*4
	add a,b	;a*4+a=5*a</PRE>

Eight is a good number too.

<PRE>	add a,a	;*2
	add a,a	;*2
	add a,a	;*2=2*2*2=8</PRE>

Try another odd number like 13 using
<CODE>sub</CODE> too. Just
<A HREF="#sub">subtract</A> the
original a few times.

<PRE>	ld b,a	;save it away temporarily
	add a,a	;a*2
	add a,a	;a*4
	add a,a	;a*8
	add a,a	;a*16
	sub b	;a*16-a
	sub b	;a*15-a
	sub b	;a*14-a=13*a</PRE>

None of these will hold an answer
over 255. Try using 16 bit register
pairs to multiply 35 and <CODE>hl</CODE>.

<PRE>	ld d,h		;save it away temporarily
	ld e,l		;save it away temporarily
	add hl,hl	;hl*2
	add hl,hl	;hl*4
	add hl,hl	;hl*8
	add hl,hl	;hl*16
	add hl,hl	;hl*32
	add hl,de	;hl*32+hl
	add hl,de	;hl*32+hl+hl
	add hl,de	;hl*32+hl+hl+hl=32*hl+3hl=35*hl</PRE>

<P>In some cases, it's easier
to add in that saved away
original at an earlier
date, like when the constant
is not near a power of 2. 20's
like that.

<PRE>	ld b,a	;save away original
	add a,a	;a*2
	add a,a	;a*4
	add a,b	;a*4+a=a*5
	add a,a	;a*10
	add a,a	;a*20</PRE>

If we didn't add in the original
early like above, our code would be
a lot longer!

<PRE>	ld b,a	;save away original
	add a,a	;a*2
	add a,a	;a*4
	add a,a	;a*8
	add a,a	;a*16
	add a,b	;a*16+a
	add a,b	;a*16+a+a
	add a,b	;a*16+a+a+a
	add a,b	;a*16+a+a+a+a=a*20</PRE>

It's a good thing we thought ahead.
Sometimes you might have to add in
the original a couple times along the
way.


<A NAME="div"></A><H2>Division</H2>
Similiar to multiplication,
just use subtraction.

<P>Let's divide <CODE>a</CODE> by <CODE>b</CODE>
(<CODE>a</CODE>/<CODE>b</CODE>).
In this routine, the answer is stored into <CODE>a</CODE>. Remember
that this is for integers that divide evenly. If you
have two numbers that you know do <I>not</I> divide
evenly, you will get an infinite loop usually (Your
calculator has <A HREF="ohno">crashed</A>).

<PRE>	ld c,$00
divide_loop:
	inc c
	sub b
	jr nz,divide_loop
	ld a,c
	ret</PRE>

If you don't mind the final answer stored in <CODE>c</CODE>,
and want to save a byte.

<PRE>	ld c,$00
divide_loop:
	inc c
	sub b
	ret z
	jr divide_loop</PRE>

This is similiar to the basic
multiplication routine: subtract
repeatedly. This routine will
also exit if <CODE>a</CODE> is zero and
become slower the larger the
operands are (more loops).

<P>Let's divide <CODE>a</CODE> by a constant
of 8 using <CODE>srl a</CODE>.

<PRE>	srl a	;/2
	srl a	;/4
	srl a	;/8</PRE>

I don't recommend using
<A HREF="../advanced/shif">shift
logically</A>
because it's two bytes long. It
is nice because it shifts the
bits right out of here.
<A HREF="../advanced/shif">Rotate</A>
is faster but it just circulates those
bits to the other side. If you're
going to use rotate, make sure
to mask off those
bits using
<A HREF="../intermediate/logi"><CODE>and</CODE></A>.
This is one byte shorter. You'll
save more bytes if you divide
by higher powers of 2 (8=2^3=2*2*2)

<PRE>	and %11111000	;mask off (get
			; rid of) last
			; three bits which
			; will be rotated
			; out
			;we don't want them
			; coming back in
			; on the other side
	rrca		;/2
	rrca		;/4
	rrca		;/8</PRE>
