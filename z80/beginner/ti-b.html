<P>I had lost all copies of this page for a while and thanks to
<A HREF="mailto:a_finne@hotmail.com">Andreas Finne</A> who happened
to have a copy backed up, the chart is back up.

<P>Most TI86 owners are already proficient in TI-BASIC.  To make
use of that knowledge, I've constructed a table with common TI-BASIC
operations and what it would look like in
<A HREF="z80p">z80</A> assembler.  All used assembler instructions
are documented in the <A HREF="inst">Instructions Section</A>.

<P><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER class="function">
	<TR CLASS=header>
