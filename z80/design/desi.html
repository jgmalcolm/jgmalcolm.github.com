<P>If you ever asked anyone whose made a successful
game, they'll tell you it took months and maybe even
a year to make the game. Nothing great comes easy
or over night.

<P>There is a process involved in making games. You
first start with ideas and progress from there
to demos and drafts, then the final edition.

<P>This process is analogous to writing an essay. You
brainstorm, outline, draft, and polish. You wouldn't
go through all that for a two paragraph essay, would
you? No, you reserve that process for larger papers.
The same goes for games; this process is only applicable
for programs 1,000 lines or more.

<P>Don't limit yourself to these steps, they can
be substituted or broken down. These are meant
to be a rough guideline. You just shouldn't change
the order drastically or skip <I>whole</I> steps.

<H2><A NAME=brai></A>Brainstorming</H2>
Walk away from the computer for this one. Get away from any
existing computer games. Go to the beach, restuarant, park, or
anywhere relaxing and quiet. You need to get away from
existing computer games or you'll just be thinking of
cloning them the whole time. You want something fresh and
new. Bring a friend to bounce ideas off of.

<P>Don't write anything down yet, atleast not specifics. Just
play with ideas right now. The really good ones should stick
in your head. That can be a test for what's good and what's
not.

<P>Brainstorming is where it all starts, the root of all good in your
program, and the root of all fundamental flaws. Keep it
simple at this point, you don't have paper to write
stuff down on so you should only play with ideas. Think
about what type of game you want, your target audience,
the language you want to write it in (in this case asm),
the time you have to complete the project, what ideas
you want to convey on the player, what emotions you
want to invoke in the player, etc.

<P>Don't limit yourself. You can do anything you
imagine through programs. All it takes is a little
time and some hard work. The sky's the limit!



<H2><A NAME=orga></A>Organization</A></H2>
Get a bunch of 3x5 index cards for this one. Start
writing your ideas on them, one-by-one. Write down
the object of the game, pictures of the title
screen, characters, plot lines, options, title,
audience, type of game (Role Playing Game, Action,
Adventure, Board, etc.), rules of the game, etc.

<P>Put all those 3x5 cards in a pile. Sort them
into broad catagories and keep narrowing those catagories
down until you can't anymore. Bounce some of the
ideas off someone else.

<P>List the basic functions needed for each of those
cards (<A HREF="../intermediate/spri.htm">Put Sprite</A>,
<A HREF="../intermediate/pixe.htm">Plot Pixel</A>, draw
<A HREF="../intermediate/tile.htm">Tile Maps</A>, display
title screen, and so on).



<H2><A NAME=code></A>Code Tree</H2>
Start designing your main functions' layout with outlines, like
you would with an essay. Use indentials for sub routines.
Here's the main outline for my <A HREF="../download/tilegen.asm">Tile
Generation Routine</A> found in the <A HREF="../intermediate/tile.htm">Tile Map</A> section.

<PRE>draw 8 rows
	draw 16 columns
		draw sprite
		increase column and repeat
	increase row and repeat</PRE>

<P>Keep going over your outlines, each time moving
in one more echelon to get more specific. The more specific
this is, the easier the actual <A HREF="#maki">game coding</A>
is.

<PRE>draw 8 rows
	draw 16 columns
		draw sprite
			get value from level data
			find sprite for that value
			draw 8 rows of sprite
				get byte from sprite image data
				draw byte onto video memory
				increase video memory to next row
				increase sprite data by a byte
				loop drawing of sprite
		increase column and repeat
	increase row and repeat</PRE>

<P>From here, writing the actual assembler instructions is
a snap! You can take a look at the
<A HREF="../download/tilegen.asm">source</A> to see what this
outline turned out to be.

<P>Make sure that when you're writing the outline, not to get
real deep into it too soon. Keep everything at the same level,
then move one more indent into the depth of each level. Then
again...



<H2><A NAME=part></A>Partial Coding</H2>
Take those notecards and start typing out the main routines
in assembler. Start with the medium ones, the ones that
don't look like a daunting task. If you hit the hardest ones
first, you could loose interest in the project; the small
ones just clutter up the place. Use
<A HREF="../advanced/asse.htm#incl">include files</A> to keep everything
sorted and separated. That way you don't have to scan through tons
of code to get to the sprite routines or something. Separate
them out into sprite bitmaps and rendering, title screen bitmap and
rendering, key handlers, main loop, and so on.

<P>This would be a good time to get a lot of the
<A HREF="../intermediate/debu.htm">debugging</A> out of the way.
Test these individual routines in demo programs all by
themselves. Try to isolate errors by putting
<A HREF="../intermediate/debu.htm#brea">break points</A>.

<P>Take a look at the <A HREF="clea.htm">Clean Code Section</A>
for tips on how to make this task easier. Here is where the rest
of this <A HREF="../index.html">Guide</A> comes into play!



<H2><A NAME=maki></A>Making the Game</H2>
Start weaving together all those functions. This is where
it gets tedious. Depending on how detailed you did the
<A HREF="#code">Code Tree</A> and <A HREF="#part">Partial
Coding</A>, this can be easy.

<P>Remember to <A HREF="../intermediate/debu.htm">debug</A>
as much as possible. The more little stuff you debug, the
less your chances are of having a monster bug later.

<P>Again, take a look at the <A HREF="clea.htm">Clean Code Section</A>
because here is where the rest of this <A HREF="../index.html">Guide</A>
comes into play!

<P>Look for bottlenecks you can optimize. Try to cut down the size
of the program as much as you can. While the TI86 has
almost "infinite" memory available, people don't
like to wait around for huge programs to transfer
from calculator to calculator. You should always want
to find the shortest and fastest way to do stuff
in all your programs.



<H2><A NAME=beta></A>Alphas/Betas/Demos</H2>
Choose five lucky individuals to test your new game. It is
best that they have some programming experience but still
be diverse among the game's targeted genre. It should be
in some playable form with a preliminary manual and documentation
completed. Don't have more than five people and make sure they
don't release the game prematurely or disclose information
on it. While gossip about a "game in the works" can bring
mystery to your game's origins, it can also mean answering a
lot of questions, losing the shock effect, or people losing
interest in your unfinished project before they have a chance
to see the full, bug-free version.

<P>You can release a demo with the core game engine with
no frills. This should center around basic game play, no options
available.

<P>Do <I>not</I> tell the testers <I>anything</I> about the game
except maybe the title. Don't ask them any questions about
any of their preferences that might trigger feelings before
gameplay. These extra emotions can contaminate their
reaction to the game. If you ask them a questions like
"Do you like a lot of graphics in a game?", they will be
on the look out for that while they are playing the game and may
be more critical towards it altering their reactions. You
want their unbiased opinion on the game, not what you
discussed with them beforehand.

<P>Schedule time to meet with these five Beta testers. Before
you do so, develop a questionnaire for them. If you can't meet
with these individuals, send them the questionnaire via email.
Ask them questions about their overall reaction to the game?
How did they like the graphics? Did they like the layout of the game?
Were the keys easy to use? Did they like the characters?

<P>Pool their answers and make changes accordingly. It's not
too late to redesign things, you still haven't released it yet.
If you do decide you need to redesign the interface or something,
repeat this step with a new set of testers.



<H2><A NAME=fina></A>Polish and Release the Final</H2>
After polishing your game for what seems like forever, "release"
it. Don't really send it out, just put it away where it's out
of sight and out of mind. Plan to come back to it in a month
or two and re-play it. Design flaws you didn't notice before
will become apparent. Fix them. You are <I>now</I> ready to
really release it to the public.

<P>Create a market for your game. If it has plug-ins, make
a handful to get the market started. Be sure to include
their source code and thorough documentation on how people
can make their own. Maybe include some templates and
tutorials for these. Finalize any level editors and their
documentation. Release copies of it everywhere. Maybe
start some gossip for it like codes and cheats.

<P>Congratulations on your new game. I hope it and
all subsequent versions are successful.
