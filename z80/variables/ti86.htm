<P>Before we even begin to talk about variables, you have to understand
how the TI86 uses memory areas called the OP_ Registers. OP stands for
OPerator. They are not really registers like <CODE>a</CODE>, <CODE>b</CODE>,
<CODE>c</CODE>, <CODE>d</CODE>, etc. They are 11 byte long areas of memory beginning
at the address <CODE>$c089</CODE> and ending at <CODE>$c0d6</CODE>.
They are where the TI86 stores the variable names, types, values,
numbers, and other junk that it needs.

<P>There are 7 OP_ Registers numbered OP1, OP2, OP3, OP4, OP5,
OP6, and OP7. Before we start to make routines, you need to have several
of the <A HREF="../download/includes.zip">include files</A> for your code
downloaded and in your include search path directory. If you have
<A HREF="http://www.acz.org" target="_blank">Asm Studio</A>,
that directory will be "Include".
