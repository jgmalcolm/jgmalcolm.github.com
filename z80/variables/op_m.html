<P>TI has given us the addresses of most of the math routines.  You can use
these routines to make some useful math programs.  Let me begin by saying
that if you're going to be making programs that do huge amounts of
calculation, you probably want to go ahead and just use TI-BASIC.  Asm is
a lot faster most of the time but it's a heck of a lot easier to make a math
program in TI-BASIC than in asm.  Just look at the
<A HREF="../beginner/ti-b">TI-BASIC versus Asm Chart</A>, you can see that
it's easier to add, subtract, multiply, divide, and store numbers in
TI-BASIC.  Just storing <CODE>.5</CODE> as <CODE>A</CODE> is somewhere
around 50 bytes in asm but only 3 or 4 in TI-BASIC.

<P>Before beginning, make sure you have the
<A HREF="../advanced/asse#incl">include</A> file
<A HREF="../download/ti86math.inc">ti86math.inc</A>. It's
also included in
<A HREF="../download/includes.zip">Includes.zip</A>. This
include file will give you the
<A HREF="../advanced/asse#equa">equates</A> for
the many Math Functions TI has given us. The comments
in the file explain the inputs and outputs
of each function.

<P>You can pretty much teach yourself this section. All you have
to do is look at some source and you'll get the basic idea.
Let's try letting the uesr input a number and display
the square root of it.
<A HREF="../download/math.asm">Download</A> it to see
what it looks like in action.
