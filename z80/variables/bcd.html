As I explained in the <A HREF="ti86">Variable Manipulation</A>
section, the OP_ Registers are also used to
store Binary Coded Numbers (BCD) for use with math routines.

<P>The OP_ Registers are 11 bytes long. They store what are called
Floating Point Numbers (the decimal point is not in a fixed position). When
you are putting <A HREF="vari">variable's names</A> into the OP_
Register, you usually use all 11 bytes; however, when you
are using the OP_ Registers for BCD numbers, you only use the first 10. The
last byte doesn't matter.

<P>The first 10 bytes are broken up into three different
parts:
<PRE>	.db <I>type/sign</I>
	.dw <I>exponent relative to $fc00</I>
	.db <I>BCD number for 7 bytes</I></PRE>

<A NAME="type"></A><H2>Type and Sign</H2>
The first byte is broken up into two things.
<OL>
	<LI>If bit 7 is set the number is negative,
	<LI>if bit 7 is reset the number is positive.
	<LI>If bit 0 is set the number is complex,
	<LI>if bit 0 is reset then it's a real number
</OL>
So there are only 4 possible combinations of numbers and what they look like.
<OL>
	<LI><CODE>$00</CODE> positive real number
	<LI><CODE>$80</CODE> negative real number
	<LI><CODE>$01</CODE> positive complex part of a number
	<LI><CODE>$81</CODE> negative complex part of a number
</OL>


<A NAME="expo"></A><H2>Exponent</H2>
The next two bytes (second and third)
of the <CODE>OP_</CODE> Register are the exponent bytes. Remember that the z80 works
by storing an address, say for example <CODE>$1234</CODE>, backwords as
<CODE>$3412</CODE> in the memory. This is called Little Indian or something.
This applies to these next two exponent bytes. They are stored <CODE>$fc00</CODE> as
<CODE>$00fc</CODE>. This is kinda
weird and took me a while to get used to how the number <CODE>$fc00</CODE> has anything
to do with the exponent. When you consider exponents
(<CODE>[number]*10^[exponent]</CODE>) you have to probably switch to Scientific
Mode on your calculator to refresh yourself on how numbers are represented in
Scientific Notation. The number <CODE>1,234,567</CODE> would be
<CODE>1.234567<FONT SIZE=1>E</FONT>6</CODE> in Scientific Notation.

<P>Let's do a quick review of Scientific Notation. When you have a number
that is normal, you move the decimal point to the left or right until you've
only got one digit before the decimal point (which has to be between 1 and
9), then you count how many decimal places you had to move it over to get
there...that number is positive if you moved the decimal place to the
left...negative if you moved it to the right. The number of places you
moved the number to the right or two the left is the exponent on the
<CODE>10</CODE>. The remaining decimal number is put before the <CODE>10</CODE>
to the [exponent] power.

		<TD><CODE>9.0009<FONT SIZE=1>E</FONT>7
</TABLE>

<P>The decimal number that is before
the <CODE><FONT SIZE=1>E</FONT></CODE> is called the mantissa, the part on the
other side is called the exponent or the power. <CODE>$fc00</CODE> is
used as the "zero" for the exponent, everything is relative to
that. You add whatever exponent you
want to <CODE>$fc00</CODE>. Here's the simple formula where <CODE>X</CODE>
is the number relative to <CODE>$fc00</CODE> and <CODE>P</CODE>
is the power you are wanting to use:

<PRE>$fc00+P=X</PRE>

<P>So, a power of <CODE>1</CODE> is <CODE>$fc01</CODE>, a power of <CODE>0</CODE>
is <CODE>$fc00</CODE>, a power of <CODE>-1</CODE> is <CODE>$fbff</CODE>, a
power of <CODE>3</CODE> is <CODE>$fc03</CODE>, and a power of <CODE>-3</CODE>
is <CODE>$fbfd</CODE>. Practice with that or something. Remember that it is
stored backwards, so <CODE>$fbfc</CODE> as a result would be stored in memory
<CODE>$fcfb</CODE>.



<H2><A NAME="bcd"></A>Binary Coded Decimal</H2>
The next 7 bytes of the <CODE>OP_</CODE> Register (remember the 8th byte which isn't
used) are used to store a number in BCD. This is simpler than it
sounds. The number <CODE>123456</CODE> is stored as <CODE>$12,$34,$56</CODE>
(or <CODE>12 34 56</CODE>). The number <CODE>4521345323</CODE>
(or broken up as <CODE>45 21 34 53 23</CODE>) would be stored as
<CODE>$45,$21,$34,$53,$23</CODE> in memory. It's so simple that I don't think
you need specific examples for this.

<P>Now that you know all the components of the Floating Point Number, let's
put it all together in some examples in yet another table!

<P>Real numbers take up 10 bytes to represent, complex numbers take up 20
bytes: the first 10 are for the real part of the number and the next 10 are
for the complex part of the number. They use the same format that the ones
above do for each part. The only difference is that if bit 0 is set it is
complex. Bit 0 of the first byte of the real part and the first byte of
the complex part will both be set if the number is complex. Remember
that the TI86 displays Complex numbers in parenthesis: (<I>Real part</I>,
<I>Complex part</I>). Here's how a complex number would be displayed like
the above numbers.

<P>A good exercise you can do is to make a routine that will take a
string pointed to be <CODE>hl</CODE> with length <CODE>b</CODE> and convert it into a
BCD number in <CODE>OP1</CODE>. I saw an example of this by
<A HREF=mailto:rabidcow@juno.com>Joshua Seagoe</A> called
<A HREF="../download/atof.asm">AtoF</A>. It will help solidify your understanding of
the format of these numbers. The AtoF routine takes a string with length
<CODE>b</CODE> and changes it into a Floating Point BCD number in <CODE>OP1</CODE>.
<OL>
	<LI>Find where the decimal point is and count left or right until
	you have the decimal in the right place.
	<LI>Add the number of places moved to <CODE>$fc00</CODE> and store that.
	<LI>Put the digits in BCD through the rest of the <CODE>OP1</CODE> register (any digits
	over the allowed 14 are left out).
