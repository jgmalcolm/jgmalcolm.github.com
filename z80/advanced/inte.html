<P>Interrupts are when regular
code execution is suspended while
a separate section of code is
executed.

<P>The
<A HREF="../intermediate/romc#_runIndicOff">Run
Indicator</A> at the top right of
the screen is an example: it is 'animated'
by the interrupts until
the calculations are finished.
The calculations don't have
to worry about redrawing it.
The interrupt routine will
check to see if the calculations
are still being performed
and, if so, continue animating
the indicator.

<P>Another example is the mouse
pointer on your computer screen.
The computer is redrawing the
mouse on the screen all the time.
When it's moved, the old
position is erased and the new
spot is rendered.

<P>TI-OS allows you to execute
your own interrupt routine 100+
times a second, while regular code
is running. This all depends upon
the battery power: faster with
fresher batteries. All you
have to do is copy
your own routine to a designated
area and set the appropriate
<A HREF="syst">flag</A>.
