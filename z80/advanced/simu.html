<P>Just an idea as of now.

<!--

_Jforcekey                   equ        40A2h
If you only want to simulate one key (upon exiting a program for example), do this:
 ld a,kEnter
 jp _jforcekey
If you want to simulate a lot of them in a row, you have to set up a sqrtKEY program and return predefined values, which is a bit more complicated.
=======
_pushQueue = $4094
.org _asm_exec_ram

    ld a,'G'
    call _pushQueue
    ld a,'o'
    call _pushQueue
    ld a,' '
    call _pushQueue
    ld a,'a'
    call _pushQueue
    ld a,'w'
    call _pushQueue
    ld a,'a'
    call _pushQueue
    ld a,'y'
    call _pushQueue
    ld a,'!'
    call _pushQueue
    ret
