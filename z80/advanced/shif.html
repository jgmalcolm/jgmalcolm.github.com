<P>Before I start to teach you the shift and rotate instructions. You
probably want to review the
<A HREF="../beginner/numb#bitp">bit placements</A>. You'll
need to look at the bit place names especially. Each
of these shift and rotate commands rotates one bit to the left or
right.

<P>There is only really one difference between the shift and rotate
instructions: rotate cycles the bits around going out one side and coming in
the other, while shift rotates the bits out one side or the other leaving
the space where the rotated bits where either unchanged or zeroed.
