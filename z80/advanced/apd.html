<p>Automatic Power Down (APD) is like a screen saver on your
computer (except it's more of a battery saver because there's
no phosporous in the screen to save). After about four minutes
with no keys being pushed, the calculator will shut down the
screen and wait until a key is pressed.

<p>The actual APD is just a counter in memory that is decreased
every interrupt (so interrupts must be enabled). When a key is
pressed, that counter starts all over again from the top. If
the counter wound down because no key was pressed, the interrupt
handler will <A HREF="onof.htm">shut down</A> and will not be
exited until the [ON] key is pressed. The screen is saved
and, when turned back on, will be displayed again along
with program execution resuming.

<p>There are a few addresses and constants you must
know about before you start working with the APD.

<PRE>;call equates for handlers
_APDHandler	=$4058	;main handler
_idle		=$405c	;shuts down if _APDWarmUp=$00
_APDSetup	=$4060	;resets _APDTimer to $a1

;memory addresses for apd counters
_APDSubTimer	=$c009	;APD sub-timer
_APDTimer	=$c00a	;APD timer
_APDWarmUp	=$c00b

;system flags at iy offset 8
APDable	=2		;enable APD counter
APDlock	=3		;lock APD
APDdone	=4		;APD has expired
</PRE>

<p>The above calls have no inputs. Let's say
you want to turn off the TI86 if nothing's
been pressed in a while, just call '_idle'.
It will check to see if it's time to shut
down the calculator based on the
<A HREF="inte.htm">interrupt
handler's</A> checking the status of
keypresses. If you want to reset the _APD
so it's fresh again, just call '_APDSetup'.
That will reset the counter at '_APDTimer' to
$a1 (its default value).

<p>At '_APDHandler', TI-OS performs
it's own updating of the APD counters. This
is run from the
<A HREF="inte.htm">interrupt
handler</A>, so don't use it on your own.

<p>If you want to turn off the APD, reset
APDable of the <A HREF="syst.htm">system
flags</A>. You need to set it before exiting
your program of the calculator won't
enable it again.

<p>Here's the code for the APD routines from
the TI86's ROM. The left most numbers are
the address of the code in hexadecimal,
then comes the code. Keep in mind that
this is for <A HREF="../beginner/ti86.htm">ROM
version 1.6</A>. The first three sets of code
will be the same on all ROM versions but where
they refer to may be different among versions.
