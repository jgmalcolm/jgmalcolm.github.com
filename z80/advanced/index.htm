<script language=JavaScript>var advanced = new Array()
advanced[0]="<H2>More Registers!</H2>Now you have even more with the addition of a whole hidden set of registers banks. Also, learn about the Index and Refresh Registers. Take your programs to a new level!";
advanced[1]="<H2>Reading Keys from Port</H2>Don't wait up for that slow <CODE>_GetKey</CODE>, scan for keys in an instant with Port 0. You can always count on the Ports for quick results. Also included, a handy reference table with key bitmasks for every key on the TI86!";
advanced[2]="<H2>Grayscale Graphics</H2>Blend black and white to make gray. Check out this line-by-line analysis of one of the hottest Grayscale routines out there!";
advanced[3]="<H2>Assembler Directives</H2>Customize your source code in a flash with macros. Reference just about every directive available for the TASM Assembler.";
advanced[4]="<H2>On-Off</H2>Turn your calculator On or Off in a flash using the ports. Even put it in low power mode to conserve energy. Take a peek at how TI-OS turns itself On and Off.";
advanced[5]="<H2>Shift and Rotate</H2>Move bits left or right within a byte. This handy reference provides examples and graphical representations of what each instruction does!";
advanced[6]="<H2>Morphic Code</H2>Programs that edit themselves, what a dream! Preload code with values, manipulate routines, and more. There's no limit to what you can do now!";
advanced[7]="<H2>All the Ports</H2>Communicate with the z80's hardware behind the scenes. Change the Video Screen address, adjust the contrast, change the power mode, and a whole lot more!";
advanced[8]="<H2>User Routines</H2>Run your code like interrupts, fonts, Silent Link, and more! Create seemless customization of your TI86 with these integrated features.";
advanced[9]="<H2>Square Root Programs</H2>Take command of the many common tasks of TI-OS such as Parsing, Tokenizing, <CODE>_GetKey</CODE>, Graphing, and much much more! TI-OS lets you run your own programs before or after it performs these tasks. Step in and manipulate data before TI-OS gets it!";
advanced[10]="<H2>System Flags</H2>Want a complete listing of TI-OS' flags? You got it! This reference gives you everything you need to know about customizing the options of TI-OS from Graph Methods to Operand calculations!";
advanced[11]="<H2>Auto Power Down</H2>Like a screen saver, TI-OS will shut down after inactivity. Learn how to control this process and use it to your advantage!";
advanced[12]="<H2>Sound</H2>Multimedia! Well, not quite, but check out how to produce mono sound with a few small parts. These step-by-step instructions walk you through the process of building speakers and then programming sound into your games. You can even convert Wave files in a flash!";
advanced[13]="<H2>Simulating Key Presses</H2>Kind of like macros, have the TI86 think you're pushing keys and respond to them when you're not even touching the calculator!";
