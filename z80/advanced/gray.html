<P>Grayscale is what makes the good graphical games. Think of
ZBlitz, Vertigo, Arkanoid, Boulder Dash, Bomberman, Diamonds, and the many other
games that use grayscale to enhance their sprites. There are many
different forms of grayscale out there. Grayscale has the basic
idea of using two or more different video screens and switching
them back and forth really fast. Each will stay visible for a different
amount of time.

<P>A graphical example might help. Screen 1 is visible a third (1/3) of
the time while Screen 2 is visible the remaining two-thirds (2/3) of
the time. The resultant shows the shade of gray viewed.

<P>If you still don't get this and you are really bored, get a black
piece of paper and a white piece. Put one in each hand and move
them back and forth really fast. You will get a blurred image that
will seem sort of gray. That's the general idea of grayscale!

<P>I've pasted <A HREF="mailto:assets@eden.rutgers.edu">Dux Gregis'</A>
<A HREF="../download/blitzgry.h">blitzgry</A> Routine here. You
can <A HREF="../download/grayscale.zip">download this</A> along with
many other grayscale routines that I've come across in the
<A HREF="../download/download">Download Section</A>. Each
line in the routine is represented by a number which corresponds
to an explanation at the end of the routine. Follow each line and
try to picture in your head what it is doing.

	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c1" NAME="l1">&uarr;</A>1
		<TD>Our interrupt is going to need to be put at $8f8f. That's
		where all interrupts are put. This runs on an interrupt so
		that every 200th of a second it will be run (200 Mhz). That's fast to
		us; it's hard to imagine how fast the processor is running. That
		all depends on battery power too. Remember, this routine is only
		to set up grayscale, it's not to put sprites and stuff on the
		screen. If you put text, it will be light colored because it's
		only on one plane (one of the two or more video memories).
		<TD>none
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c7" NAME="l7">&uarr;</A>7
		<TD>Now we are going to switch
		to grayscale mode. We need to prep
		everything and copy the grayscale interrupt routine to where
		it needs to be.
		<TD>none
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c8" NAME="l8">&uarr;</A>8-11
		<TD>We are going to use the video
		memory ($fc00 to $ffff) for one
		plane and the graph screen (_plotScreen to $cdf9 1024 bytes) for
		the other plane. The graph screen needs the first 6 bytes
		to keep for system use. We are going to have to save those
		six bytes and put them back later. Our routine will use the
		entire area, including the six bytes we saved away. We are going
		to save them using a block copy to a part of our code.
		<TD>11
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c13" NAME="l13">&uarr;</A>13-17
		<TD>The interrupt system uses a
		256 byte long vector table
		for it's interrupt routines to know which addresses to
		call. We need to put $8f8f into all the slots in the
		vector table. We use another block copy to put $8f repeatedly
		which makes $8f8f8f8f8f8f8f8f which is the address we want over
		and over and over again.
		<TD>13
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c19" NAME="l19">&uarr;</A>19-22
		<TD>Now we want to actually put
		our routine at $8f8f to be called every
		interrupt (approximately 200 times a second). Remember in
		<A HREF="#c1">line 1</A> where we made an alias to
		<CODE>int_addr =$8f8f</CODE> so we won't have to
		type $8f8f anymore. It's easier to remember int_addr being where
		the interrupt address is than the $8f8f stuff. Between lines
		<A HREF="#c73">73</A> and <A HREF="#c115">115</A> is our
		interrupt to be copied so we just use a block copy.
		<TD>11
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c24" NAME="l24">&uarr;</A>24
		<TD>We don't want to see that little busy indicator at the top
		that TI doesn't do away with, so we call a routine that turns
		it off. The TI86 automatically turns it back on when the asm
		program is done. I just wish it would turn it off for us. That
		would be 3 bytes saved for every program made.
		<TD>3
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c30" NAME="l30">&uarr;</A>30
		<TD>We are going to use the shadow registers so we need to
		disable interrupts for a second while we put some data in
		the shadow registers for use during the grayscale routine. The
		grayscale routine will exchange out the shadow registers with
		the regular ones and so it will have the contents of the shadow
		registers to use which we have prepared.
		<TD>1
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c31" NAME="l31">&uarr;</A>31
		<TD>Change out <CODE>bc, de,</CODE> and <CODE>hl</CODE> with their shadow
		registers. We won't be needing to change out <CODE>af</CODE> with
		its shadow register because <CODE>a</CODE> changes so much and we don't
		need the flags.
		<TD>1
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c32" NAME="l32">&uarr;</A>32
		<TD>$3c is used in conjunction with port 0 (which we will learn
		about later) to tell the TI86 which part of memory is to be used as
		the video memory. $3c would tell the processor it needs to
		use $fc00 as the video memory. $0a would mean $ca00 as the start
		of the video memory. You don't really have to understand this
		yet.
		<TD>2
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c33" NAME="l33">&uarr;</A>33
		<TD>We are going to need to save which port (port 0) we are using
		so we can reference it faster during the routine.
		<TD>2
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c34" NAME="l34">&uarr;</A>34
		<TD>We are going to use 5 as a counter.
		<TD>2
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c35" NAME="l35">&uarr;</A>35
		<TD>When you xor %110110 with $3c you get $0a which is the other
		value we need for port 0.
		<TD>2
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c36" NAME="l36">&uarr;</A>36
		<TD>This is the counter which we are going to need to time how long
		different planes are visible.
		<TD>3
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c37" NAME="l37">&uarr;</A>37
		<TD>Put back all the shadow registers in their place for use
		during the grayscale routine.
		<TD>1
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c38" NAME="l38">&uarr;</A>38-39
		<TD>We need to zero the UserCounter. <CODE>Xor a</CODE> is a one byte method
		of <CODE>ld a,0</CODE> which is two bytes. It's faster and saves a byte. Like
		most counting, we start from zero and work our way up.
		<TD>4
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c41" NAME="l41">&uarr;</A>41-42
		<TD>Remember that <CODE>i</CODE> used with <CODE>r</CODE> together tell where on
		the vector table the interrupt handler is supposed to be. We need
		to put the address of the vector table ($8e) into <CODE>i</CODE> to make
		up the most significant byte of the address.
		<TD>4
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c45" NAME="l45">&uarr;</A>45-46
		<TD>Start up Interrupt Mode 2 on <A HREF="#c45">line 45</A>
		and then Enable Interrupts
		on <A HREF="#c46">line 46</A>.
		<TD>3
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c47" NAME="l47">&uarr;</A>47
		<TD>No need to explain.
		<TD>1
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c53" NAME="l53">&uarr;</A>53
		<TD>Now that we've got the routine to turn on grayscale mode, we
		need a routine to turn it off.
		<TD>none
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c54" NAME="l54">&uarr;</A>54
		<TD>Start up interrupt Mode 1 again.
		<TD>2
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c55" NAME="l55">&uarr;</A>55-56
		<TD>Remember port 0 is the port for the video memory. We are going
		to send $3c out it which tells the TI86's screen to show from
		$fc00 to $ffff as the video memory.
		<TD>4
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c58" NAME="l58">&uarr;</A>58
		<TD>Clear the screen at $fc00.
		<TD>3
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c60" NAME="l60">&uarr;</A>60-64
		<TD>Since <CODE>_clrLCD</CODE> only clears <CODE>$fc00</CODE> to
		<CODE>$ffff</CODE>, we need to make our
		own routine that will clear the graph memory (our second plane). We
		are going to clear the first byte of the graph screen, then copy it
		to the second byte. Then we are going to copy the second byte to the
		third byte. Now each byte gets cleared by the previous loop of
		<CODE>ldir</CODE>. This is really handy to know. There are 1024 bytes to
		clear. Think about how this works because you can use it in a lot of
		things.
		<TD>13
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c66" NAME="l66">&uarr;</A>66-69
		<TD>Remember in lines <A HREF="#c8">8</A> through
		<A HREF="#c11">11</A> when we saved those precious first
		six bytes of the graph screen? Well, we need to put them back now.
		<TD>11
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c71" NAME="l71">&uarr;</A>71
		<TD>Done with it all!
		<TD>1
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c73" NAME="l73">&uarr;</A>73
		<TD>This is an assembler directive which I will teach you about
		later. Don't pay attention to it now.
		<TD>none
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c75" NAME="l75">&uarr;</A>75
		<TD>Now we're going to start the actual routine to continuously
		switch between each of the two video planes.
		<TD>none
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c76" NAME="l76">&uarr;</A>76-77
		<TD>This is sometimes called while another code is being run
		in normal mode. We break for a micro-second and run this. Because
		of this we need to save the registers that the other code was
		using so it will have them when it is resumed. We need to save
		them before we do our routine and return them like they were
		after we're done switching video planes. Remember that we
		saved some data in the shadow registers before we started, we're
		going to exchange the registers so that the regular registers will
		be filled with that data. When we're done we'll put that data
		back in and return our parameters to the shadow registers.
		<TD>2
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c79" NAME="l79">&uarr;</A>79-81
		<TD>Bit 1 of port 3 is to tell us if the video screen is in the
		middle of refreshing itself or not. If bit 1 is reset, the screen
		is refreshing and we shouldn't flip panels in the middle of a
		refresh. These refreshes take mini-micro-seconds.
		<TD>6
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c83" NAME="l83">&uarr;</A>83
		<TD>Remember that <CODE>hl</CODE> was loaded with the address of
		the <CODE>UserCounter</CODE> which we had saved in our
		parameters. We want to increment that because it's our
		counter.
		<TD>1
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c84" NAME="l84">&uarr;</A>84
		<TD>We saved <CODE>c</CODE> with 0, so we can save a byte by not
		putting in <CODE>out (0),a</CODE>. That one byte difference makes
		the routine faster. Our sending $3c or $0a through port
		0 will change part of memory to be shown on the screen, which
		changes between $fc00 and $ca00.
		<TD>2
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c86" NAME="l86">&uarr;</A>86-87
		<TD>To give 4 shades of gray (white, light gray, dark gray,
		black), we have to hold one of the planes
		up for a little longer than the other. Remember that we loaded
		<CODE>d</CODE> with 5. We use that as a counter to let one show 3
		times when the other only shows 1. If the counter falls to
		zero after we decrease it, we call the routine to reset the counter
		and change planes.
		<TD>4
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c88" NAME="l88">&uarr;</A>88-90
		<TD>We now need to check to see if we need to flip planes. We
		started at <CODE>d</CODE> being 5 and decreased it until it was 2. While
		we are decreasing it, one of the planes is on the screen. When it
		hits 2, we change to the other plane for the remaining two
		decreases. That's 3 decreases on one plane and 2 on the other.
		<TD>6
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c92" NAME="l92">&uarr;</A>92
		<TD>We are going to have to leave now. We need to put the remains
		of the parameters back into the shadow registers and clean up to
		return from the interrupt.
		<TD>none
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c93" NAME="l93">&uarr;</A>93-94
		<TD>We need to check the status of the [ON] button. We get
		a byte from port 3 and rotate (We'll discuss that later) it
		once to the right. The bit rotated out is put in the carry. That
		means that the carry is either set or reset.
		<TD>3
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c95" NAME="l95">&uarr;</A>95-97
		<TD>Remember that <CODE>c</CODE> was zero because we were saving that
		for referencing port 0 when changing video pages. We need
		to zero <CODE>a</CODE>, so we can either <CODE>xor a</CODE>, <CODE>sub a</CODE>,
		or, <CODE>ld a,c</CODE> (because <CODE>c</CODE> is zero at this time). Each of
		those are one byte long and so are faster than
		the two byte <CODE>ld a,0</CODE>. We use <CODE>adc</CODE> to
		add 9 to whatever is in
		<CODE>a</CODE> and then add the carry flag (either of value 1 or 0)
		to <CODE>a</CODE> on top of the 9 we are already loading. <CODE>A</CODE>
		will either be 9 or 10 ($09 or $0a; %00001001 or %00001010). That
		will turn the screen back on. We refreshed it when it was off I
		think. We now turn it on.
		<TD>5
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c98" NAME="l98">&uarr;</A>98-99
		<TD>Now we need to send %00001011 through port 3 to do something. I
		don't know this junk.
		<TD>4
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c101" NAME="l101">&uarr;</A>101-102
		<TD>We need to put back the parameters in the shadow registers
		and return the regular registers to what they were before we
		started our grayscale interrupt routine.
		<TD>2
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c103" NAME="l103">&uarr;</A>103-104
		<TD>We need to enable interrupts (<A HREF="#c103">line 104</A>)

		from the whole interrupt thing. Instead of just the regular
		return, this also checks the state of the interrupts for the
		system.

	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c107" NAME="l107">&uarr;</A>107-108
		<TD>This is part of a call that is just added onto the front of
		the routine that changes pages. This part resets the counter
		and then leads right into the page changing routine.
		<TD>2
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c109" NAME="l109">&uarr;</A>109-114
		<TD>Remember that <CODE>e</CODE> has a value that when <CODE>xor</CODE>ed with
		our byte to be sent to change the video planes, will yield
		what we need to use next time for switching video planes. We
		load our mask into <CODE>a</CODE> and <CODE>xor</CODE> it with
		<CODE>b</CODE> and put the result back into <I>b</I>. Then we're
		done with this call.

	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c116" NAME="l116">&uarr;</A>116
		<TD>This is an easy way for us to determine in
		<A HREF="#c21">line 21</A> how
		much we need to copy and paste. We let the assembler figure
		out the length of the interrupt code by subtracting the
		beginning address from the end. This gives us the difference
		in the addresses which is the length of the code we need.
		<TD>none
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c118" NAME="l118">&uarr;</A>118-119
		<TD>This is where we store the data to use in our routine. This
		isn't copied cause we don't need to have it with the routine. It
		can be stored with the rest of this
		<A HREF="../download/blitzgry.h"><CODE>blitzgry.h</CODE></A> code in your
		program.
		<TD>7
	<TR>	<TD><A HREF="#c121" NAME="l121">&uarr;</A>121
		<TD>We're done, and we need to tell the assembler that.
		<A HREF="asse#end"><CODE>.end</CODE></A> does just that.
