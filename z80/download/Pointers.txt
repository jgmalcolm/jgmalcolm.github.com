		CUSTOM MENU POINTERS
			by Benjamin Setton


These are pointers for the CUSTOM Menu on the TI 86.
See the file '86custom' by Andres Garcia to know how to set CUSTOM entries
in ASM.

You will define the options like this:

Option1:
	.db $45,$29,072h,052h,075h,06Eh,00,00,00,00,00
		     x   S     p    e    e    d
$45,$29 will set the pointer to CONV SPEED. I have listed the other
values and their effects here.
The file included is an example that will set Run as F4 and Speed as F5.
