<P>You're lucky: The
<A HREF="../beginner/z80p.htm">z80 microprocessor</A> has
one of the shortest instruction sets of operation codes! That means
you don't have to memorize thousands upon thousands of
individual commands. There are only 677 commands for the
z80, that's not much when you consider the thousands for the
<A HREF="http://www.intel.com/intel/museum/25anniv/hof/8080.htm"
target="_blank">Intel's 8080</A>.

<P>An opcode is an instruction.

<PRE>	ld hl,xxxx
	out (x),a
	cp xx</PRE>

These are just a few examples. Each opcode is actually
one or more bytes that tell the z80 what to do.
The processor doesn't see <CODE>cp (hl)</CODE> or
<CODE>ld a,b</CODE> but instead sees <CODE>$be</CODE>
and <CODE>$78</CODE> respectively. The z80 performs
the operation assigned to that byte value.

<P>For <CODE>call xxxx</CODE>, the processor will
see <CODE>$cd</CODE>. Once it sees that value,
it knows it has to use the next two consecutive
bytes in memory for the address to call.

<P>So, when you type the code...

<PRE>	call $1234
	ld hl,$ff
	cp b</PRE>

The z80 sees...

<PRE>	cd3412
	21ff00
	b8</PRE>

<P>Do you want to view the list of z80 standard operation codes
organized by <A HREF="opcodesB.htm">byte value</A> or
in <A HREF="opcodesN.htm">alphabetical order</A>?
