<P>It may be helpful (though I never found a use for this) to know that
you can access the TI-OS' own menu structures, found on ROM page 1.  These
mostly don't help because they consist of Menu Slot Type $03 which is
used to execute an asm program.  We don't know much about the use of this
type so it's really not that much use to us to work with this.  You might
still want to take a look at ROM page 1, the first part is the pointers and
menu structures, then following is the actual menu slot data.
