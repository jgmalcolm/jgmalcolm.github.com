	<TR>	<TD CLASS=header>Error
		<TD>Two errors.  First, <CODE>_getkey</CODE> will not return to your program
		until a key is pressed.  You can just jump to the routine like a
		pause that will continue if any key was pressed.  If [ON] was pressed,
		it will return $00 and gives ERROR 06 BREAK and give you the option
		to exit to the homescreen.  The second error is with the
		<CODE>cp $00</CODE>.  Remember back to our
		<A HREF="../intermediate/logi">logical
		operators</A>, <CODE>or
		<CODE>arg1</CODE></CODE> will return any bits set in either
		<CODE>arg1</CODE> or <CODE>a</CODE>.  So, if you <CODE>or a</CODE>, it
		will return any bits set
		in <CODE>a</CODE> or <CODE>a</CODE>...itself!  So if <CODE>a</CODE>
		does not have any bits set, it will leave <CODE>a</CODE> as zero and set the
		<A HREF="../beginner/flag">Zero Flag</A>.  <CODE>Or a</CODE>
		is also only one
		byte so it is faster than the two byte <CODE>cp $00</CODE>
		or <CODE>cp 0</CODE>.  This little
		change is only to speed up the <CODE>cp $00</CODE> part of
		the above code, but we
		don't even need it if we are going just jump to the routine and not worry
		if zero was returned.
