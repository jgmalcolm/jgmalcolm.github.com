<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER class="recode">
	<TR WIDTH="30%">
		<TD CLASS=header>Purpose
		<TD>Fastest routine possible to see if the Down Arrow
		key has been pushed.  Keep looping until it has been
		pushed.
	<TR>	<TD CLASS=header>Code
		<TD><PRE>keyport	=1			;key port
loop:
	ld a,%11111110		;row to check for
	out (keyport),a		;send it out to get checked
	in a,(keyport)		;collect results
	rrca			;put down arrow's bit in
				; the carry flag
	jr nc,loop		;carry=held down
				;if carry...continue
	<TR>	<TD CLASS=header>Error
		<TD>Absolute jumps are 2 clock cycles faster because
		the z80 doesn't have to add relative addresses to the
		program counter.
		<P>Also, by saving the <A HREF="../intermediate/read">Key
		Port</A> value in <CODE>c</CODE>, we can access it faster.
	<TR>	<TD CLASS=header>Fixed Code
		<TD><PRE>keyport	=1			;key port
	ld c,keyport		;faster access later
loop:
	ld a,%11111110		;row to check for
	out (c),a		;send it out to get checked
	in a,(c)		;collect results
	rrca			;put down arrow's bit in
				; the carry flag
	jp nc,loop		;carry=held down
				;if carry...continue
