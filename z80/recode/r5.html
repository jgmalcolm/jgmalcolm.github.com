		<TD CLASS=header>Purpose
		<TD>Load zero into six sequential memory areas.
	<TR>	<TD CLASS=header>Code
		<TD><PRE>	ld a,$00	;byte to be stored
	ld (mem_1),a	;load into memory
	ld (mem_2),a	; addresses 1-6
	ld (mem_3),a
	ld (mem_4),a
	ld (mem_5),a
	ld (mem_6),a
	<TR>	<TD CLASS=header>Error
		<TD>Two errors in this one also. The first is that
		you can use your <A HREF="../intermediate/logi">logical
		operators</A> to zero <CODE>a</CODE> just as easily as
		<CODE>ld a,$00</CODE>. Try
		<CODE>xor a</CODE>. It will take <CODE>a</CODE> and <CODE>a</CODE> (itself...if you
		haven't caught on yet) and if a bit is set in one and not the
		other, then that bit will be set in the new <CODE>a</CODE>. Since
		both bits will be the same because it is the same register, the
		result will have no bits set in it, thus zero. The second
		error is one of size. Every time you load a memory address
		with <CODE>a</CODE>, you take three bytes. That's okay if we're
		only going to do it one or two times but if we want to do it
		four or more times to sequential memory addresses, then you want
		to try using the <A HREF="../intermediate/misc">block copy</A>
		instruction <CODE>ldir</CODE> to copy a byte that's been zeroed to the
		following memory address, and then incrementing both to do it
		again (the address copying from having been zeroed the previous
		loop). This works great for zeroing temporary memory locations
		at the start of your programs or clearing parts of the screen
		for graphics.
		<P>Speed up the routine even more by waiting until you've loaded
		<CODE>bc</CODE> with <CODE>6</CODE> before clearing <CODE>(hl)</CODE>.
		When you load <CODE>bc</CODE> with <CODE>6</CODE> you are clearing
		the Most Significant Byte (<CODE>b</CODE>) because <CODE>6</CODE>
		is <CODE>$0006</CODE> in Hexadecimal; so, we might as well
		use that to clear <CODE>(hl)</CODE> while we have it!
	<TR>	<TD CLASS=header>Fixed Code
		<TD><PRE>	ld hl,mem_1	;source
	ld de,mem_2	;destination
	ld bc,6		;how many bytes to copy
			;clears c also
	ld (hl),b	;what's going to be copied
	ldir		;(hl) to (de); inc hl & de;
			; dec bc; repeate till
			; bc=$00000
