		<TD CLASS=header>Purpose
		<TD>Load <CODE>a</CODE> with 69 and compare it to 68 (<CODE>cp 68</CODE>),
		display <CODE>Z</CODE> if the zero flag was set or <CODE>N</CODE> if it was
		reset.  Assume this is a call and that the cursor coordinates
		are already set up.
	<TR>	<TD CLASS=header>Code
		<TD><PRE>	ld a,69		;number to check
	cp 68		;number to compare it to
	jr z,zero	;if zero branch to 'zero'
	jr nz,not_zero	;it n-zero branch to 'not_zero'
zero:
	ld a,'Z'	;load a with letter
	jr display_it
not_zero:
	ld a,'N'	;load a with letter
display_it:

	<TR>	<TD CLASS=header>Error
		<TD>Remember that the <A HREF="../beginner/flag">flags</A>
		are stored as bits in the <CODE>f</CODE> register.  Bits have two
		possible states:  set or reset.  This means that the condition
		could only have resulted in zero or not zero.  If we test
		for only one of those conditions we will know what the zero
		flag's status is.  It's kinda like getting the wrong answer on
		a true/false test...if you put 'true' and got it wrong, then you
		know the answer's 'false'!  Using this we can rearrange the
		order of the components of that routine and only have to test
		one condition.  If that condition is false, then don't branch
		(another name for jump) and lead into the next segment of
		code.  We were good to use a lead in after the 'not_zero'
		component.
