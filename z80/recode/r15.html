	<TR>	<TD CLASS=header>Error
		<TD>This may be the shortest way to
		clear the screen but it sure isn't the fastest.  This
		routine has to switch ROM pages to be run which
		takes time.  the following code is the fastest but
		is about 10 bytes longer.  It clears (loads with <CODE>l</CODE>
		which was just cleared) byte A first.  After
		that it copies the cleared byte A to byte B, increases
		both so we now are going to load the recently cleared
		byte B into byte C and so on.
		<P>Some people do <CODE>ld (hl),$00</CODE>
		but since we just cleared <CODE>l</CODE> with <CODE>ld hl,$fc00</CODE>,
		we can just use <CODE>ld (hl),l</CODE> saving one byte.
	<TR>	<TD CLASS=header>Fixed Code
		<TD><PRE>clear_screen:
	ld hl,$fc00	;start of video memory
	ld (hl),l	;l=$00 so we clear (hl)
	ld de,$fc01	;2nd byte in video mem
	ld bc,1023	;size of video mem-1
			; since de is start+1
	ldir		;copy already cleared
			; byte from hl into de
			; then increase so hl
			; points to what was
			; just cleared and de
			; the byte after
	ret		;we're done
