		<TD CLASS=header>Purpose
		<TD>Put $1234 into every even (since it's two bytes) memory address
		for 1000 bytes starting at $8000 using a loop instead of <CODE>ldir</CODE>.
	<TR>	<TD CLASS=header>Code
		<TD><PRE>	ld bc,1000/2	;we are only doing every other byte
	ld hl,$8000	;address to start at
	ld de,$1234	;what to write
loop:
	ld (hl),d	;load $12 in
	inc hl		;increase to next address
	ld (hl),e	;load $34 in
	inc hl		;increase to set up for next loop

	<TR>	<TD CLASS=header>Error
		<TD>Decreasing 16 bit register pairs (<CODE>dec bc</CODE>) doesn't affect the
		zero or carry flags.  We can use <A HREF="../intermediate/logi">Logical
		Operators</A> to see if any bits in either <CODE>b</CODE> or <CODE>c</CODE>
		are set with <CODE>or</CODE>.
