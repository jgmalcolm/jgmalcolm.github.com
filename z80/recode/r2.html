		<TD CLASS=header>Purpose
		<TD>Put the string "Stupid" on the screen at column 4, row 20 in
		menu size font.
	<TR>	<TD CLASS=header>Code
		<TD><PRE>	ld b,20			;row 20 in b
	ld c,4			;column 4 in c
	ld hl,stupid_string	;string address
	call _vputs		;put string
	ret			;return
stupid_string:	.db "Stupid",0	;string to put
	<TR>	<TD CLASS=header>Error
		<TD>There are two errors in this one.  The first error is that
		there you don't need to load in the coordinates separately, you can
		load them into the <CODE>bc</CODE> register all at once.  The second
		error is that if you have a call (<CODE>call _vptus</CODE>) followed
		by a return instruction (<CODE>ret</CODE>), you can change the call to
		a jump and take out the return.  This uses that call's own
		return as yours.  It's like jumping to another part of your code
		from which you will return out of your routine.  Remember that you
		have to use an absolute jump (<CODE>jp</CODE>) instead of a relative
		jump (<CODE>jr</CODE>).
	<TR>	<TD CLASS=header>Fixed Code
		<TD><PRE>
	ld bc,256*20+4		;20 in b, 4 in c
	ld (_penCol),bc		;load those coordinates
	ld hl,stupid_string	;string address
	jp _vputs		;put string & return
stupid_string:	.db "Stupid",0	;string to put
