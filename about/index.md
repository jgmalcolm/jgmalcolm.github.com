I'm James, and I'm interested in tools, technology, and ideas.  I'm currently
a medical student in Atlanta, creator of [Pharm450](//pharm450.com),
co-creator of [ArrayFire](http://arrayfire.com),
[scientist](/pubs/research.html), and husband.

I'd really like to hear from you, so shoot me an email!  Have some thoughts on
what you read here?  Want to chat about ideas?  Email me!  In the Atlanta area
and want a restaurant rec?  I've got you covered.

I genuinely would like to meet you.  If you're interested in anything you've
found on my website, then we've got something in common.

The best way to reach me is via email: <a id="email"></a>.
