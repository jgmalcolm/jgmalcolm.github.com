Dear Friend,

Thank you for visiting our wedding website!

We feel incredibly blessed to be beginning this exciting stage of our lives
with such an outpouring of love and support from our beloved family and
friends.

We're so excited to announce that our wedding ceremony will be held in Paris,
France on June 24, 2014.

We cannot wait to celebrate with our family and friends with two receptions to
be held in the metro Atlanta area in the summer months following our wedding.

Please feel free to peruse these links to the left for information about our
upcoming wedding.

With all our love,

Kristin & James
