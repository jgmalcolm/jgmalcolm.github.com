Our Wedding Events

We (James and Kristin) have decided to run away together (with parents and
siblings in tow, of course!) to the beautiful, charming, and wondrously
romantic capital of France.

Our ceremony will take place in the late afternoon in the Chappelle Expiatoire
(8Ã¨me arrondissement) on the 24th of June. Our ceremony will be followed by a
brief photoshoot featuring all our favorite spots in Paris and an intimate
dinner with our parents and brothers and sister at Restaurant Lasserre.

We are so thrilled at the romantic prospect of escaping away together, but of
course we do still want to celebrate upon our return with all our beloved
family and friends....

So, we have decided to have two mini-receptions following our wedding and
honeymoon.

We want to thank you all so much for the outpouring of love, support,
encouragement, and enthusiasm that has surrounded our decision to become one
in marriage, in love, and in Christ.
