It was mid November, 2011....

James: One week I simply decided to plan something new, so I decided to buy a ticket to the local Atlanta Symphony Orchestra.  After picking a section, it randomly assigned me a seat: R-12.

Kristin: I was having a crazy busy week at Tech - between two jobs and a full class schedule I felt that I was constantly running from one activity to the next. I decided that I was in need of a night to myself; so I bought a ticket to the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and was randomly assigned a seat. The night in question was homecoming night for Georgia Tech, so the traffic in and around Tech campus was terrible and at one point I almost decided that sitting in the traffic jams wasn’t worth it and that I should just turn my car around.

I arrived a few minutes early, and as I shuffled down the aisle to take my seat, I notice a cute blonde girl in the seat next to me.  Neither of us make eye contact or say hello, and being a bit shy, I bury my nose in the event program, but all through the first half I’m contemplating my opening line.

I arrived and found my seat. R-23. At that point I started studying the program rather intensely since I was there alone. A few moments went by before a girl approached me and asked if I wouldn’t mind switching seats with her since the ticketing program had accidentally separated her from her friends. I obliged and switched seats. R-13 now. I continued reading the program until a young man politely excused himself for having to step over me to get to his seat. I noticed that he had come alone. Well-dressed. He checked a few emails on his phone before flipping casually through the program. I couldn’t very well stare at his face without being overly obvious so I spent the remaining time before the start of the symphony casting furtive sidelong glances at his profile. Handsome...

Intermission comes and we each wander separately in the lobby.  Returning a few minutes before the second half, I decide now’s the moment for my genius opening: “So I notice you reading the program -- are you a musician?”  I pretty much won her over then and there.

During Intermission I jumped up out of my seat and ran to hide in the crowds that were inundating the lobby. Stranger-to-stranger casual small talk is not my forte. And I was terrified that I would inevitably say something stupid. I sat in the lobby for a while looking at my phone for texts. No texts. Eventually I gave up and went back into the auditorium where I proceeded to read the detailed musical analysis of the night’s program. He returned only a few moments before the orchestra was to start back up. I suppose that he assumed (by the way in which I was studying the musical analysis - like my life depended on it) that I was a musician of some kind (hardly) and he struck up a conversation about the music and the performance. He was kind and genuine. And (gazing at his entire face for the first time) very handsome.

The concert ends and we make our way to the exit.  We exchange some pleasantries about the performance, but all the while I’m spinning on what to say and how to stretch the time.  This girl has captured my attention.  As we each start heading to different exits, I decide it’s now or never.  I worked up the courage to ask her out for dessert next door.  And the rest is history...

The performance ended and we both made our way to the exit. I began to walk toward the parking deck and it became clear that he was headed the other direction. I still didn’t know his name...“Well, it was nice meeting you --” I called out over my shoulder and turned to go. I took a few steps toward my car when he called out from behind me: “Wait! Do you --- want to grab a glass of wine or something?” I admit that, here, I hesitated. It was a Thursday night and I had unfinished homework for the next day. I contemplated giving a standard “Thanks, but I’ve got a lot of work left to do - school night, you know -- see you around!” response, but there was something so different, so sincere, so genuine about the way that he stood there in the lamplight waiting for my response. And I thought: why not? The next few hours were a blur of conversation and laughter, a glass of wine and dessert. And the rest is history...
