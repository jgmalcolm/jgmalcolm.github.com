## Every rotation

Equipment: several pens (be prepared to give them away), pen light, note
cards, stethoscope, [scutsheets](http://www.medfools.com/downloads.php).

Surgery likely doesn't need your stethoscope.  Psych probably doesn't need
anything beyond pens; leave your tie and white coat at home so a patient
doesn't strangle you or get intimidated.  An ophthalmoscope is handy on
consult services where you're unlikely to have tools handy.

Graduate from Wikipedia to [UpToDate.com](//uptodate.com).  This is the most
well-organized resource I've found for efficient, practical, and comprehensive
research on topics encountered in clinical medicine.  Hopefully your school
provides you with a subscription.


## Presenting on rounds

**Gather the information.** Before diving into the digital records, ask the
night staff if there were any updates.  I tend to check the medical records
before examining the patient; this might provide overnight clues that will
guide my physical exam.  Sometimes you might want to briefly glance at the
patient to get basic vitals and then come back later for a thorough exam.
When examining a patient in the wee hours of the morning, be nice: use your
penlight as much as possible instead of flipping on the overhead lights.

**Put together the story.** Use only 50% of the data, but be prepared if asked
about the other 50%.  Giving 100% of the details in an unorganized fashion
forces the attending to work at making sense of the situation.  Don't fall
into the trap of being proud of yourself that you were able to spew out all
kinds of detailed data rapid fire.  Better to tell a logical story at normal
rate.

**H&P versus SOAP.** On inpatient services, you present new patients
differently than ones that have been on your service a night or two.  New
patients need a full H&P that includes the history of how they got to your
service so everyone's on the same page (eg. emergency department course).
From the second day onward, you report using a SOAP note only highlighting
overnight events, new lab values, and plan changes.


## Neurology

**Pregame.** Specific equipment for the physical exam:  reflex hammer, tuning
fork, safety pins, ophthalmoscope. Practice your complete neuro exam.  Review
anti-epileptic drugs for seizure control and pain management, calcium channel
blockers for treating vasospasm, beta blockers for lowing blood pressure, and
anesthetics.  Get familiar with one of the [NIH Stroke Scale apps][stroke].

**Shelf.** About 200 questions in UWorld and 500 in
[Neurology Pre-Test][]. I've heard [Neurology Clinical Cases][] is good but I
had my hands full with UWorld and Pre-Test.  From UWorld, consider also
including ophthalmology.  The [NBME] subject tests were a closer approximation
to the actual shelf exam, but since the NBME tests don't have explanations,
the UWorld and Pre-Test explanations were still necessary.

## Pediatrics

**Pre-game.** Kids are not like adults, so print out some reference material
for developmental milestones, a template review of systems so you hit on
pediatric-specific questions during your H&Ps.  Watch some videos of the
pediatric physical exam.

**Pediatric H&Ps are not adult H&Ps.** If a child is in the first decade of
life, you should ask about birth history, feeding, development.  Carry a
reference sheet with developmental milestones and, for their age, ask about
the four areas.

**CLIPP Cases.** These cover about 30 basic scenarios you'll encounter daily.
Do a quick pass in the first week of your rotations so you're familiar with
the content.  Then do a subsequent slower pass to truly study the material
before the shelf.
