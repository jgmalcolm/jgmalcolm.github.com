## Surgery

**Pre-game.** This is nothing like your other rotations.  Read the first
section of [Surgical Recall] to orient yourself to what's expected, what to
touch, names of instruments, and answers for all the classic pimping questions
you'll get on rounds or in the OR.  Doing a gallbladder?  Know Calot's
triangle.

**Shelf.** Similar to the medicine shelf, but focused on management more so
than pathophysiology.  For the bread and butter, you'll need to know when to
manage conservatively and when to head to the OR.  Do all the UWorld questions
for Surgery, GI, Renal, and Electrolytes, and do them twice.  Consider taking
one or both of the NBME Self Assessments.  [Pestana] is an excellent, concise
book covering the bread and butter general surgery, but also all the
specialties included on the shelf: ortho, neuro, urology, pediatrics, burns,
etc.  Find the audio that accompanied an earlier version.  It walks through
several hundred very simple vignettes, each with a slight variation from the
previous to emphasize teaching points on differences in management.  This is
about 13 hours, so listen to it while exercising or on the commute.

## Medicine

**Pre-game.** Understand how to read an EKG; plenty of great online videos:
[basics](http://zapt.io/tqyjd4ju), [rate & rhythm](http://zapt.io/tfxkvx9d),
[intervals](http://zapt.io/t4cubvtk).
[Pocket Medicine]
has been invaluable.  Whenever I'm about to examine a patient for a chief
complaint I'm not as familiar with, I hit that page and this gives me
questions for my history, physical exam findings to look for, differential
diagnosis to consider, and tests to order.  Look like a rock star because you
covered all the bases.  Consider getting a digital copy for your phone/tablet
instead of lugging around the little notebook.

**Shelf.** UWorld is all you need to do well.  Absolutely do all 1300
questions.  [MKSAP] is great but extra.

## Neurology

**Pregame.** Specific equipment for the physical exam:  reflex hammer, tuning
fork, safety pins, ophthalmoscope. Practice your complete neuro exam.  Review
anti-epileptic drugs for seizure control and pain management, calcium channel
blockers for treating vasospasm, beta blockers for lowing blood pressure, and
anesthetics.  Get familiar with one of the [NIH Stroke Scale apps][stroke].

  [stroke]: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/10-second-stroke-scale/id478624302?mt=8

**Shelf.** About 220 questions in UWorld covering Neurology and Ophthalmology,
plus the two [NBME] subject tests which were quite similar to the real deal.
[Neurology Pre-Test][] is okay if you want more practice, but only if you've
finished UW and NBME.  I've heard [Neurology Clinical Cases][] is good but I
had my hands full already.

## Pediatrics

**Pre-game.** Kids are not like adults, so print out some reference material
for developmental milestones, a [template review of systems][peds-ros] so you
hit on pediatric-specific questions during your H&Ps, and watch some videos of
the [pediatric physical exam][peds-pe], carry around a template
[checklist][peds-pe-checklist] and try to hit more of it with each new exam.
Newborns labs have their own range of normal; get familiar with heart rate,
respiratory rate, febrile thresholds in neonates, infants, and toddlers.  Get
a basic outline of how to workup common problems: respiratory distress,
[neonatal jaundice][jaundice], fever of unknown origin, etc.

  [jaundice]: http://www.meddean.luc.edu/lumen/MedEd/peds/newborn_pe_exercise.pdf
  [peds-ros]: http://www.utmb.edu/pedi_ed/CORE/Neonatology/page_02.htm

  [peds-pe-checklist]: http://www.meddean.luc.edu/lumen/MedEd/peds/newborn_pe_exercise.pdf

**Pediatric H&Ps are not adult H&Ps.** If a child is in the first decade of
life, you should ask about birth history, feeding, development.  Carry a
reference sheet with developmental milestones and, for their age, ask about
the four areas.

**CLIPP Cases.** Available from [MedU](//www.med-u.org/clipp).  These cover
about 30 basic scenarios you'll encounter daily.  Do a quick pass in the first
week of your rotations so you're familiar with the content.  Then do a
subsequent slower pass to truly study the material before the shelf.

**Handle with care.** You'll find they're pretty resilient.  I doubt you'll
drop a child, but another important aspect of handling with care involves
diaper mishaps.  During your physical exam, always position the diaper over a
little boy's private parts.  The time when you have them fully exposed should
be on the order of seconds.  When checking femoral pulses, shields up.
Further, before picking a child up to coddle, check the diaper.  Your clothes
will quickly soak up a wet diaper.  This is experience talking.  For Peds,
OB/Gyn, and Surgery you'll want to have a full change of scrubs in your locker
or car.

**Nursery.** The newborn physical exam looks for specific physical findings
from the birth process: birth trauma and deformities from in utero
positioning, skin findings such as umbilical site, jaundice, rashes, etc.
Your history will need to assess this pregnancy and delivery as well as
previous pregnancies.  Know jaundice and respiratory distress cold.  Normal
vitals are unique in the first few days.
