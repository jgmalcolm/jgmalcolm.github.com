While most of this is from med-school tests, the principles apply to nearly
all multiple choice exams.

## Practice

Only through practice on questions will you improve your technique, accuracy,
endurance, and learn what's important.  Do not passively read your review
books and notes.  You should jump into doing questions before you feel ready.
If you wait until you feel ready, you’re too late.  Questions sharpen
contrasts, a key part of learning to differentiate diseases and disorders.
Don’t wait until you’ve reviewed to start questions; consider the questions
and working through the explanations as part of the learning process.
Wrestling with a question and the immediate emotional and intellectual
feedback of seeing the answer helps solidify the knowledge.  There's some
evidence that if you take a pretest before you've even been exposed to
material, [you'll do better][failing] when it comes to the actual test
afterward.  If your scores are not improving or you simply feel lost, you
might not be ready.  Consider stepping back to review more.

Drilling on questions also helps you understand your own psychology.
Recognize the signs that you’re tiring or getting sloppy, and learn to
refocus.  Recognize your proclivities to jump toward certain answers, not read
the question fully.  One odd thing I noticed is that, for questions where two
answers are very close, I tended to prefer the first of the two.  Once I
recognized this tendency, I started catching myself and instead focus on those
choices without bias.

Practice these techniques below so they’re second nature and you kill bad
habits.  But techniques will only tweak your performance.  There are no true
shortcuts on these exams and these techniques only work when you already have
the core knowledge.



## The first and last sentences

Read the first sentence and then the last sentence.  Skip everything in
between for the moment.  Skim the answer choices.  Now you've got your
context.  You know what topics are going to be relevant.  You know what type
of answer is expected.  As you go through the rest of the scenario and answer
choices, your brain is already working quietly to connect the dots.  You're
primed to pay close attention to key information as you continue reading.

At this point, you can skim the answer choices and probably immediately rule
out one or two.  In some cases, the answer is obvious (but don't jump until
you've read everything)..

Finally, go back to read the rest of the scenario and attack the answer
choices.

You’ll avoid the situation where you’re reading along thinking you know
exactly the diagnosis, only to come to the end and realize the prompt is
asking you something different like a side effect of the treatment for that
obvious disease.  If you had known the prompt, you could have been reading the
scenario and already thinking of how to make a connection to the prompt.
Wasted time and energy.

If there’s an image, look at it before reading the full question to see if you
recognize anything.  Often, after only reading the final prompt and glancing
at the answer choices, you can already rule out one or more wrong choices in
seconds.  Classic histology can be a tip off.


## The aftermath

Always review explanations.  First for the correct answer, second for your
wrong answer, but also for all the other answers.  Look for how you could have
ruled out each wrong answer.  Find the topic in your notes, underline the
tested fact, emphasize the most important physical or lab findings, etc.  Put
a tally mark in the margin indicating the topic was tested.  Over time, the
highly tested topics become apparent.

The NBME self assessments do not allow you to review individual answers.
These are still good uses of time because you practice your technique against
the real benchmark and you do get an idea of your weak subjects.



## High-Yield Material

Not all information is weighted equally.  Every time a concept is tested, put
a dot in the margin of your notes.  You'll soon start to see which topics are
most important.  Taking it one step further, you might want to only note items
you get wrong: no sense noting what material you already know.




## Review topics, not isolated details

If you get a question wrong, don't just memorize the specific fact you missed.
Go and skim over the entire disease or pathway in context.  If the answer
stems were all a cluster of related diseases, skim those and understand how to
compare and contrast.  If it was a bone tumor question and the answer was a
particular bone cancer, review the specifics of that cancer, but also do a
quick recap of the other ones.  If the answer was a particular enzyme in the
purine salvage pathway, review the entire pathway.  Take every opportunity to
learn in context.


## Attacking a question bank

Consider doing a test with all easy questions so you can start easing into
concepts and get some positive vibes going.  However, don’t be fooled into
thinking this is your actual performance until you’ve cut your teeth on some
harder questions.


## The first sentence contains a big clue.

The first sentence contains probably the most important clue and sets the
context.  Here are a few classic tip-offs.

* chief complaint - your diagnosis must absolutely explain this
   * whatever the patient came in complaining of is the most important thing to address
* race - anytime race is mentioned, it’s a clue
   * African-American - HTN, sickle cell, autoimmune
   * white - cystic fibrosis, membranous nephropathy
   * Greek, Italian - classic Mediterranean patients - B-thalassemia
* sex - female autoimmune
* age - diseases sometimes target a rough age range: childhood, middle age, elderly
   * 1-2 yo boy - think x-linked
* obese - DM2
* occupation, home environment - environmental exposure
   * farmer - moldy hay - hypersensitivity
   * construction worker, old apartment, painter - lead poisoning
* exotic environment
   * an emergency department in the third world - think of old drugs not used anymore in the US
      * Chloramphenicol causing aplastic anemia (no longer used in US but might encounter in third world)
* immigrant who recently became ill
   * immigrated long ago: unvaccinated
   * immigrated recently: endemic disease


## Avoid outliers

> * Oxygen curve is shifted to the left because A.
>   (If you have to guess, don’t choose this one.  Notice how it’s the only answer choice that uses "left".)
> * Oxygen curve is shifted to the right because of B.
> * Oxygen curve is shifted to the right because of C.
> * Oxygen curve is shifted to the right because of D.

## A single phrase can rule out an answer choice

The question prompt may mention an ancillary test that was performed whose
only purpose is to rule out one specific answer choice.

> Patient presents with X, Y, Z that appear to be some form of anemia.  In the
> course of workup, <u>direct Coombs test was negative</u>.
>
> * A
> * B
> * <strike>Autoimmune hemolysis</strike>
> * D

## Every abnormal lab value needs to be explained

Your answer needs to account for every abnormal lab value given.  If there’s
some seemingly completely unrelated lab value that’s wildly abnormal and you
cannot explain it with your answer, then think harder about the other choices.

## Ruling out answers & guessing intelligently

Never jump to an answer without first ruling out 1-2 choices.  This will make
sure you’re paying attention and not just jumping for a distractor.  Once you
rule out a choice, you can completely forget about it and focus your attention
on comparing the remaining choices.

If you have to guess, do so intelligently:

* If you’ve narrowed it down to two possibilities, the most common disease is
  probably the best answer.  Avoid [zebras].
* If there are multiple answers that are equivalent and one that is different,
  then it's likely the equivalent group is all wrong together.
* If two answers are the opposite of each other, then the answer is likely one
  of those.  Ignore the other choices.
* An adult patient with no mention of chronic or childhood issues, then rule
  out congenital diseases that would have shown up in early childhood
  (e.g. hemophilia, sickle cell).  Anything that occurs suddenly without any
  history, think acquired instead of congenital.


## Classic clues

There are some triggers that should perk your ears to a likely diagnosis.

* African-American female - autoimmune
* 20-40yo female - autoimmune, multiple sclerosis
* "Patient presents to emergency room..." - unlikely a chronic issue, acute often means vascular
* "Complaining of progressive symptoms for several months" - tumors can develop over months
* Infant or first few weeks of birth - genetic
   * no family history - recessive
* female - ignore x-linked
* "multiple rounds of antibiotics" - no gut flora causing Vitamin K deficiency
  (bleeding), C diff


## Question stems

Specific constructs can help clue you in.

* “What is most likely” - forget about rare diseases, just think what is
  really prevalent.  No [zebras].

[zebras]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra_(medicine)


## Answer choice tip-offs

* If most of the questions (3-4) have the same base phrase but differ in the
  second half, look to choose among those if you have to guess.

> Patient is having a reaction to heparin.
>
> - Discontinue heparin, do X.
> - Discontinue heparin, do Y.
> - Discontinue heparin, do Z.
> - Do something completely different.    (probably the wrong answer)

* One answer may refer to a combination of others.  Often you can ignore the
  other choices not involved in that combination.  This shows up more so on
  lower quality tests.

> Question, blah, blah, blah.
>
> - Dog
> - Cat
> - Tiger
> - Dog & Cat   (probably ignore Tiger and choose some combination of Dog/Cat)


## Read the entire question carefully.

Your middle school teacher was right.  As you’ve gotten used to banging
through questions, sometimes a question will seem so easy that you jump right
to the answers looking for what you already have in mind.  Test-writers know
this too and can create a dead obvious question except for one small detail
that totally changes.  And they know exactly the trap answer to put for those
zipping through.  Make sure you’ve taken into consideration every single
symptom.
