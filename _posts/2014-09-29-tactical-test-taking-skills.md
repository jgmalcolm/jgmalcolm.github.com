Lessons learned from taking thousands of multiple choice questions.

# Practice

Only through practice on questions will you improve your process, accuracy,
endurance, and learn what's important.  Do not passively read your review
books and notes.  You should jump into doing questions before you feel ready.
If you wait until you feel ready, you’re too late.  Questions sharpen
contrasts, a key part of learning to differentiate diseases and disorders.
Don’t wait until you’ve reviewed to start questions; consider the questions
themselves part of the learning process.  Wrestling with a question and the
immediate emotional and intellectual feedback of seeing the answer helps
solidify the knowledge.

Drilling on questions also helps you understand your own psychology.
Recognize the signs that you’re tiring or getting sloppy, and learn to
refocus.  Recognize your proclivities to jump toward certain answers, not read
the question fully.  One odd thing I noticed is that, for questions where two
answers are very close, I tended to prefer the first of the two.  Once I
recognized this tendency, I started catching myself and instead focus on those
choices without bias.

Practice these techniques below so they’re second nature and you kill bad
habits.  But techniques will only tweak your performance.  There are no true
shortcuts on these exams and these techniques only work when you already have
the core knowledge.

# Avoid outliers

> * Oxygen curve is shifted to the left because A.
>   (If you have to guess, don’t choose this one.  Notice how it’s the only answer choice that uses "left".)
> * Oxygen curve is shifted to the right because of B.
> * Oxygen curve is shifted to the right because of C.
> * Oxygen curve is shifted to the right because of D.

# A single phrase can rule out an answer choice

The question prompt may mention an ancillary test that was performed whose
only purpose is to rule out one specific answer choice.

> Patient presents with X, Y, Z that appear to be some form of anemia.  In the
> course of working, <u>direct Coombs test was negative</u>.
>
> * A
> * B
> * <strike>Autoimmune hemolysis</strike>
> * D

# Every abnormal lab value needs to be explained

Your answer needs to account for every abnormal lab value given.  If there’s
some seemingly completely unrelated lab value that’s wildly abnormal and you
cannot explain it with your answer, then think harder about the other choices.

# Ruling out answers

* Never jump to an answer without first ruling out 1-2 choices.  This will
  make sure you’re paying attention and not just jumping for a distractor.
  Once you rule out a choice, you can completely forget about it and use brain
  power to compare the remaining choices.
* If there are multiple answers that are similar to each other, then they are
  probably all incorrect.
* If you’ve narrowed it down to two possibilities, the most common disease is
  probably the best answer.  Avoid [zebras].
* If two answers are the opposite of each other, then the answer is likely one
  of those.  Ignore the other choices.
* An adult patient with no mention of chronic or childhood issues, then rule
  out congenital diseases that would have shown up in early childhood
  (e.g. hemophilia, sickle cell).  Anything that occurs suddenly without any
  history, think acquired instead of congenital.


# Classic demographics

There are some triggers that should perk your ears to a likely diagnosis.

* African-American female - autoimmune
* 20-40yo female - autoimmune, multiple sclerosis
* “Patient presents to emergency room” - unlikely a chronic issue
* Infant or first few weeks of birth - genetic
   * no family history - recessive
* female - ignore x-linked
* “multiple rounds of antibiotics” - no gut flora - Vit K deficiency
  (bleeding), C diff


# The first sentence contains a big clue.

* chief complaint - your diagnosis must absolutely explain this
   * whatever the patient came in complaining of is the most important thing to address
* race - anytime race is mentioned, it’s a clue
   * African-American - HTN, sickle cell, autoimmune
   * white - cystic fibrosis, membranous nephropathy
   * Greek, Italian - classic Mediterranean patients - B-thalassemia
* sex - female autoimmune
* age - diseases sometimes target a rough age range: childhood, middle age, elderly
   * 1-2 yo boy - think x-linked
* obese - DM2
* occupation, home environment - environmental exposure
   * farmer - moldy hay - hypersensitivity
   * construction worker, old apartment, painter - lead poisoning
* exotic environment
   * an emergency department in the third world - think of old drugs not used anymore in the US
      * Chloramphenicol causing aplastic anemia (no longer used in US but might encounter in Guatemala)


# The last sentence is the first sentence

Read the last sentence of the question first.  Then go back to read from the
start of the scenario.  This frames what you’re being tested on and you’ll be
more primed to pay attention to key information.  You’ll avoid the situation
where you’re reading along thinking you know exactly the diagnosis, only to
come to the end and realize the prompt is asking you something different like
a side effect of the treatment for that obvious disease.  If you had known the
prompt, you could have been reading the scenario and already thinking of how
to make a connection to the prompt.  If there’s an image, look at it before
reading the full question to see if you recognize anything.  Often, after only
reading the final prompt and glancing at the answer choices, you can already
rule out one or more wrong choices in seconds.


# Question stems

Specific constructs can help clue you in.

* “What is most likely” - forget about rare diseases, just think what is
  really prevalent.  No [zebras].

# Answer choice tip-offs

* If most of the questions (3-4) have the same base phrase but differ in the
  second half, look to choose among those if you have to guess.

> Patient is having a reaction to heparin.
>
> - Discontinue heparin, do X.
> - Discontinue heparin, do Y.
> - Discontinue heparin, do Z.
> - Do something completely different.    (probably the wrong answer)

* One answer may refer to a combination of others.  Often you can ignore the
  other choices not involved in that combination.  This shows up more so on
  lower quality tests.

> Question, blah, blah, blah.
>
> - Dog
> - Cat
> - Tiger
> - Dog & Cat   (probably ignore Tiger and choose some combination of Dog/Cat)


# Read the entire question carefully.

Your middle school teacher was right.  As you’ve gotten used to banging
through questions, sometimes a question will seem so easy that you jump right
to the answers looking for what you already have in mind.  Test-writers know
this too and can create a dead obvious question except for one small detail
that totally changes.  And they know exactly the trap answer to put for those
zipping through.  Make sure you’ve taken into consideration every single
symptom.


# High-Yield Material

Not all information is weighted equally.  Every time a concept is tested, put
a dot in the margin of your notes.  You'll soon start to see which topics are
most important.



# The aftermath

Always review explanations.  First for the correct answer, second for your
wrong answer, but also for all the other answers.  Look for how you could have
ruled out each wrong answer.  Find the topic in FA and make notes, underline
the tested fact, emphasize the most important physical or lab findings, etc.
Put a tally mark in the margin indicating the topic was tested.  Over time,
the highly tested topics become apparent.

The NBME self assessments do not allow you to review individual answers.
These are still good uses of time because you practice your techniques against
the real benchmark and you do get feedback on weak subjects (not individual
topics or questions).


# Attacking a qbank

Consider doing a test with all easy questions so you can start easing into
concepts and get some positive vibes going.  However, don’t be fooled into
thinking this is your actual performance until you’ve cut your teeth on some
harder questions.
