Med school is all test after test after test, and so a little over a year into
it and I'm noticing some patterns.  Here are simple strategies that brought
order to chaos.  While most of this is from med-school tests, the principles
apply to nearly all multiple choice exams.

## Practice questions

Only through practice on questions will you improve your technique, accuracy,
endurance, and learn what's important.  Do not passively read your review
books and notes.

You should jump into doing questions [before you feel ready][retrieval].  If
you wait until you feel ready, you’re too late.  Questions sharpen contrasts,
a key part of learning to differentiate diseases and disorders.  Don’t wait
until you’ve reviewed to start questions; consider the questions and working
through the explanations as part of the learning process.

Reviewing and accumulating all the random facts is just part of studying for
an exam; another big part is learning how to make sense of all those facts and
how they relate, an experience that you only get from working through
questions that put these random facts in context and draw contrasts.

Wrestling with a question and the immediate emotional and intellectual
feedback of seeing the answer helps solidify the knowledge.  There's some
evidence that if you take a pretest before you've even been exposed to
material, [you'll do better][failing] when it comes to the actual test
afterward.  If your scores are not improving or you simply feel lost, you
might not be ready.  Consider stepping back to review more.

Drilling on questions also helps you understand your own psychology.
Recognize the signs that you’re tiring or getting sloppy, and learn to
refocus.  Recognize your proclivities to jump toward certain answers, not read
the question fully.  One odd thing I noticed is that, for questions where two
answers are very close, I tended to prefer the first of the two.  Once I
recognized this tendency, I started catching myself and instead focus on those
choices without bias.

Practice these techniques below so they’re second nature and you kill bad
habits.  But techniques will only tweak your performance.  There are no true
shortcuts on these exams and these techniques only work when you already have
the core knowledge.

The NBME self assessments do not allow you to review individual answers.
These are still good uses of time because you practice your technique against
the real benchmark and you do get an idea of your weak subjects.

Doing more questions can also perpetuate bad habits.  If you stop improving or
regress in performance, it's a sign you've settled into some bad habits.
Investigate why you're choosing wrong answers to see a pattern emerges.



## The first and last sentences

Read the first sentence and then the last sentence.  Skip everything in
between for the moment.  Skim the answer choices.  Now you've got your
context.  You know what topics are going to be relevant.  You know what type
of answer is expected.  As you go through the rest of the scenario and answer
choices, your brain is already working quietly to connect the dots.  You're
primed to pay close attention to key information as you continue reading.

At this point, you can skim the answer choices and probably immediately rule
out one or two.  In some cases, the answer is obvious (but don't jump until
you've read everything)..

Now go back to read the rest of the scenario and attack the remaining answer
choices.

You’ll avoid the situation where you’re reading along thinking you know
exactly the diagnosis, only to come to the end and realize the prompt is
asking you something different like a side effect of the treatment for that
obvious disease (second-order sequence instead of first-order recall).  If you
had known the prompt, you could have been reading the scenario and already
thinking of how to make a connection to the prompt.  Wasted time and energy.

If there’s an image, look at it before reading the full question to see if you
recognize anything.  Often, after only reading the final prompt and glancing
at the answer choices, you can already rule out one or more wrong choices in
seconds.  Classic histology or gram staining is "classic" for a reason.


## Study the answer explanations

Always review explanations.  First for the correct answer, second for your
wrong answer, but also for all the other answers.  Specifically look for how
you could have ruled out each incorrect answer.

Find the topic in your notes, underline the tested fact, emphasize the most
important physical or lab findings, etc.  Put a tally mark in the margin
indicating the topic was tested.  Over time, the highly tested topics become
apparent.  Not all information is weighted equally, and you'll soon start to
see which topics are most important.  Avoid cluttering your notes and only do
this for things you got wrong.



## Record a learning point for tough questions

Create a spreadsheet recording a learning point for every question you got
wrong.  Keep this very simple and low-friction.  Don't complicate this because
you don't need to come back and review.  Just the simple act of recording the
topic and learning point forces you to synthesize a factoid suitable for
cerebral storage.  If you got a question right but just barely, consider
recording the learning point to solidify your thinking.  Just as you take
notes while you're studying lectures, treat question banks as study time and
take a few simple notes.

Instead of simply stating the correct answer or tested fact, put it in
contrast with the wrong answer you picked.


## Review topics, not isolated details

If you get a question wrong, don't just memorize the specific fact you missed.
Go and skim over the entire disease or pathway in context.  If the answer
stems were all a cluster of related diseases, skim those and understand how to
compare and contrast.  If it was a bone tumor question and the answer was a
particular bone cancer, review the specifics of that cancer, but also do a
quick recap of the other ones.  If the answer was a particular enzyme in the
purine salvage pathway, review the entire pathway.  Take every opportunity to
learn in context.


## Attacking a question bank

Consider doing a test with all easy questions so you can start easing into
concepts and get some positive vibes going.  However, don’t be fooled into
thinking this is your actual performance until you’ve cut your teeth on some
harder questions.


## The first sentence contains a big clue.

The first sentence contains probably the most important clue and sets the
context.  Here are a few classic tip-offs.

* chief complaint - your diagnosis must absolutely explain this
   * whatever the patient came in complaining of is the most important thing to address
* race - anytime race is mentioned, it’s a clue
   * African-American - HTN, sickle cell, autoimmune
   * white - cystic fibrosis, membranous nephropathy
   * Greek, Italian - classic Mediterranean patients - B-thalassemia
* sex - female autoimmune
* age - diseases sometimes target a rough age range: childhood, middle age, elderly
   * 1-2 yo boy - think x-linked
* obese - DM2
* occupation, home environment - environmental exposure
   * farmer, veterinarian - animal exposure, hypersensitivity to moldy hay
   * construction worker, old apartment, painter - lead poisoning
* exotic environment
   * an emergency department in the third world - think of old drugs not used anymore in the US
      * Chloramphenicol causing aplastic anemia (no longer used in US but might encounter in third world)
* immigrant or foreigner visiting who recently became ill
   * arrived long ago: unvaccinated
   * arrived recently: endemic disease


## Avoid outliers

If you have to guess, don’t choose the first one here.  Notice how it’s the
only answer choice that uses "left".

> * Oxygen curve is shifted to the left because A.
> * Oxygen curve is shifted to the right because of B.
> * Oxygen curve is shifted to the right because of C.
> * Oxygen curve is shifted to the right because of D.

Boards questions almost always give you enough information to make a
diagnosis, and rarely is a patient without risk.  So avoid those answer
choices:

> * The patient is at risk because of X.
> * <strike>The patient has no risk because of Y.</strike>
> * <strike>Not enough information is provided to make a diagnosis.</strike>

## A single phrase can rule out an answer choice

The question prompt may mention an ancillary test that was performed whose
only purpose is to rule out one specific answer choice.

> Patient presents with X, Y, Z that appear to be some form of anemia.  In the
> course of workup, <u>direct Coombs test was negative</u>.
>
> * A
> * B
> * <strike>Autoimmune hemolysis</strike>
> * D

## Every abnormal lab value needs to be explained

Your answer needs to account for every abnormal lab value given.  If there’s
some seemingly completely unrelated lab value that’s wildly abnormal and you
cannot explain it with your answer, then think harder about the other choices.

## Ruling out answers & guessing intelligently

  [guessing]: #ruling-out-answers--guessing-intelligently

Never jump to an answer without first ruling out 1-2 choices.  This will make
sure you’re paying attention and not just jumping for a distractor.  Once you
rule out a choice, you can completely forget about it and focus your attention
on comparing the remaining choices.

If you have to guess, do so intelligently:

* If you’ve narrowed it down to two possibilities, the most common disease is
  probably the best answer.  Avoid [zebras].
* If there are multiple answers that are equivalent and one that is different,
  then it's likely the equivalent group is all wrong together.
* If two answers are the opposite of each other, then the answer is likely one
  of those.  Ignore the other choices.
* An adult patient with no mention of chronic or childhood issues, then rule
  out congenital diseases that would have shown up in early childhood
  (e.g. hemophilia, sickle cell).  Anything that occurs suddenly without any
  history, think acquired instead of congenital.


## Classic clues

There are some triggers that should either perk your ears to a likely
diagnosis or rule out specific answer choices:

* African-American female &rarr; autoimmune
* 20-40yo female &rarr; autoimmune, multiple sclerosis
* "Patient presents to emergency room..." &rarr; unlikely a chronic issue,
  acute often means vascular
* "Complaining of progressive symptoms for several months" &rarr; tumors can
  develop over months
* Infant or first few weeks of birth &rarr; genetic
   * no family history &rarr; recessive
* female &rarr; ignore x-linked
* "multiple rounds of antibiotics" &rarr; no gut flora causing Vitamin K
  deficiency (bleeding), C diff
* medication that was recently prescribed &rarr; side effects causing chief
  complaint
* multiple sexual partners, IV drug use &rarr; consider STDs or HIV/AIDS and
  opportunistic infections
* "Family history of <symptoms/disease>" &rarr; this always factors into the
  diagnosis



## Question stems

Specific constructs can help clue you in.

* "What is most likely" - forget about rare diseases, just think what is most
  prevalent.  No [zebras].  It's likely more than one answer is possible, but
  you're being tested on epidemiological prevalence to determine the most
  likely.

[zebras]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra_(medicine)


## Answer choice tip-offs

If most of the questions (3-4) have the same base phrase but differ in the
second half, look to choose among those if you have to guess.

> Patient is having a reaction to heparin.
>
> - Discontinue heparin, do X.
> - Discontinue heparin, do Y.
> - Discontinue heparin, do Z.
> - Do something completely different.    (probably the wrong answer)

One answer may refer to a combination of others.  Often you can ignore the
other choices not involved in that combination.  This shows up more so on
lower quality tests.

> Question, blah, blah, blah.
>
> - Dog
> - Cat
> - Tiger
> - Dog & Cat   (probably ignore Tiger and choose some combination of Dog/Cat)


## Three types of questions

There are three types of questions: those you know immediately, those you
don't have the knowledge to answer, and those that you'll end up pondering.
Every question is worth the same as every other question, so you can be
strategic about how you spend your time and energy.

For the easy bread-and-butter questions, answer them immediately to lock in
the majority of your points.  Mark and skip any question that requires more
than a minute of thought or where you simply don't have the requisite
knowledge.

For these marked questions, go carefully and spend the time.  These questions
will make the difference between pass and high pass.

It's a death trap to fritter away your time on questions you'll ultimately
guess on.  [Narrow it down to 2-3 choices and guess][guessing].  You want to
avoid the situation where you've got 10 minutes left but 20 questions, and so
you make sloppy mistakes on easy ones.


## Read the entire question carefully.

Your middle school teacher was right.  As you’ve gotten used to banging
through questions, sometimes a question will seem so easy that you jump right
to the answers looking for what you already have in mind.  Test-writers know
this too and can create a dead obvious question except for one small detail
that totally changes.  And they know exactly the trap answer to put for those
zipping through.  Make sure you’ve taken into consideration every single
symptom and avoid the knee jerk choice.
