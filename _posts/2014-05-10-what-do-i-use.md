A list of tools I use daily to work efficiently, stay focused, and keep
organized.

* Macbook Air 11"
* [Spectacle](http://spectacleapp.com) to move and resize windows with hot keys
* [Aud√©o earbuds](http://www.amazon.com/Audeo-Perfect-Bass-Earphones-Black/dp/B003V9QDXK) - excellent sound, tight fit[^bench]
* [Google apps](http://www.google.com/enterprise/apps/business) - get Gmail, Calendar, Drive, etc all using my own jgmalcolm.com domain
  * quickly add calender entries with this [bookmarklet][calender]
  * find out which company has sold your email address with this [Gmail trick][gmail]
* [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_US/chrome/browser/) web browser with extensions:
  * [Adblock] to knock out advertisements
  * [LastPass] to keep all my passwords safe, quickly log me into sites, and fill out tedious forms
  * [Google Drive Offline][offline] to enable editing documents and slides without internet
  * [Google Quick Scroll] to jump right to the interesting bits of an article based on your Google search terms
* [MenuMeters] to keep an eye on CPU, memory, internet speed, etc.
* [Witch] to switch between the individual windows of an application (Mac OSX
  only lets you switch between full applications, not between Word docs)
* [Wikipedia interface tricks]({% post_url 2014-04-26-wikipedia-tricks %}) to navigate and view images more efficiently
* [Airfoil] to route Chrome, YouTube, and any audio from my laptop to [Bose Airplay][bose] speakers
* [Caffeine] to keep my Mac from going to sleep while I'm presenting or surfing
* [Flux] to alter my laptop's screen colors to the time of day
* [SelfControl], [ColdTurkey], and [Block Site] to keep me off facebook, email, and the news when I need to be productive
* [IFTTT] to record all my tweets and facebook posts so I can find cool articles later
