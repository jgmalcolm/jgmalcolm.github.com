I typically start with:

> "What medications are you currently taking?"

Meds often give you a list of the patient's diseases, but often meds become so
routine that patients omit one or two when you ask.  For example, synthroid,
aspirin, and statins are often left off the list because a patient has been
taking them for as long as they can remember.  Patients are more apt to report
something they started taking a few months ago, not the med they've been
taking for 10 years.

So this is often just a good start, but the next three questions will help
make sure you have all the information.


> "What pills do you put in your mouth every day?"

Restating it this way often shakes out one or two loose meds.  Also go beyond
pills and prescriptions:  herbals, over the counter, vitamins, supplements.

<!-- Sidebar: pre-natal vitamins pack a powerful punch of vitamins and minerals -->
<!-- which can interfere with the absorption of other medications like insulin, so -->
<!-- taking them at the same time could bind the insulin rendering it ineffective. -->
<!-- Solution: take one in the morning and the other at night. -->

Just having the list is not enough.  For every med on that list, you need two
more things: why are they taking the pill, are they actually taking the pill.

> "Why are you taking that?"

Meds have off-label uses or can be used to treat multiple disorders.  Don't
just assume that because the patient is on synthroid that they have
hypothyroidism -- they could have had a thyroid removed due to cancer.

> "How often do you miss a dose?"

So many patients are ill simply because they're skipping doses.  Other
variants: Are you actually taking it?  How many doses have you missed in the
last month?  A common scenario is for a hypertensive patient on medication to
show up with high blood pressure because they forgot to take their meds that
morning or ran out a week ago.

Often patients simply forget, so walk them through some strategies to
remember: pill boxes, rituals (at breakfast, when setting alarm at night, in
car while commuting), or multiple pill caches for when you forgot and you've
already left the house.
