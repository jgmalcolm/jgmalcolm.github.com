I'm fortunate to have had many opportunities to travel under various
circumstances, packing everything from business suits to backpacking gear,
sleeping anywhere from luxury hotels to a rental car, cleaning up under a
trailer park hose or out of a train car sink.  Here are some practical tips I
picked up along the way.


## Basics

**Plastic bags** for dirty clothes or a wet bathing suit.

**[Kindle]** <a

books than you can possibly read.  I also setup
[Instapaper article delivery](https://www.instapaper.com/apps).

**Ear plugs and head phones** because you never know when you'll be seated
next to a crying two-year-old.  I really like the
[Jarv NMotion Sport Wireless Bluetooth] headphones to avoid cords getting
caught.

**[Day pack]** that stuffs down.  Ditch your big travel backpack and carry
just the essentials while you're out and about.

**Two pens and scratch paper.** Use pens that won't leak.  Folded computer
paper is good, but notecards might be more durable.

**Granola bars, almonds, and other TSA-friendly snacks** for when you're
caught between meals, tired of airplane food, or not interested in a $12
sandwich in the terminal.

**[Portable battery]** <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ITILPZ4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00ITILPZ4&linkCode=as2&tag=jgmalcolm-20&linkId=3WTM7NSD7S7XTNCF"><img class="thumb" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412NAqrHJ%2BL._SL110_.jpg" ></a> for when you're stuck without an outlet and need a few
watts.

**[Power strip]** with multiple ports, USB, and ground.  Never again feel
sheepish asking if you can bump someone off the only outlet available because
your phone is about to die but you're so close to a new high score on Candy
Crush.  Nevermind, you should feel sheepish.

## Clothes

**Drier sheets.** Stuff a few fresh ones throughout your clothes to keep your
laundry smelling fresh throughout the trip.

**Rolling a bundle of clothes to avoid wrinkles.** When shirts and pants are
individually folded and packed, wrinkles are inevitable.  Stack several dress
shirts on top of each other, toss some t-shirts in the center, and fold the
dress shirts around the bulky t-shirts to avoid sharp fold creases.

**Pack loose.** Even if you folded your dress clothes neatly, squishing them
down can still leave wrinkles.  Pack everything else tight and put your dress
clothes in last and loose.

**Dirty laundry bag.** Preferably one that's water and smell proof.  Don't
rely on plastic grocery bags; get something a little more sturdy.

**Take care of your fancy dress shoes.** To avoid scuff marks, stuff them into
large socks or wrap them in old t-shirts.  To avoid smashing them or causing
creases in the leather, stuff them full of socks and underwear for some
internal support.

**A duplicate set of all your toiletries.** When you travel regularly, it gets
stupid to continually pack and unload your toiletries.  You'll soon forget
something.  Stock a travel kit that you know to be complete and ready every
time.  Restock it after every trip.  Instead of using some generic
travel-sized shampoo and soap, buy [reusable 3oz travel containers][gotoob]
and fill them with the shampoo and soap you're hair and body are used to.
When you find a brand you like, always stock up on extras; running out of
something you knowingly use daily is just a sign of poor planning.  Consider
putting these all in a heavy duty zip-lock in case something leaks or is still
wet when you have to rush to the airport.  For razors, put a large black
binder clip around the blade portion to keep it from getting dulled.

## International

**Hit up the airport ATM.** Before you leave the destination airport, get some
local cash.  Fees from your home bank and the local ATM are likely fixed (not
percentage), so withdraw enough to make these fees a trivial fraction.  Avoid
the currency exchanges with their ridiculous rates.

**Notify credit/debit card companies in advance.** Ask for an increase in your
daily withdrawal limit.  You don't want to be stuck on day one.  Don't assume
it'll work because you have a pin.  Do this online or by phone a day or two in
advance.

**Split up your cards and cash.** Keep a small amount of cash and one card in
easily accessible pockets.  The bulk of your cash should be either safely
locked in the hotel or in a hard to access internal pocket.  Consider for a
moment if you get robbed; while you'll likely be quickly let go, you may be
searched for additional money and valuables.  For the small amount of easily
accessible money, consider that sticking your hand in and out of your pocket
all day might cause the money to fall out.  Partition your assets.

**Eye patch and inflatable pillow.** Catch some rest whenever and wherever.

**Photocopy your passport.** Put copies in all your luggage and carry-on.
Write your contact information on these copies.  Besides this backup copy, you
want at least two forms of identification, and you want to store them in two
separate locations.

**Plan on doing laundry.** Only pack clothes for 5-7 days.  Even when
traveling on some remote islands, I've always been able to find local services
to do my laundry.

**Band aids, neosporin, sunscreen, needle, & thread.** For any trip with the
potential for adventure.


# Miscellaneous

**Hijack hotel TVs** When staying in a hotel, skip the annoying local network
and TV guide and instead plug in your Chromecast/Fire/equivalent for full
control.

**Packing list.** I tend to pack last minute, but to minimize the risk of
forgetting something on a new adventure I will start days ahead creating a
packing list of anything that comes to mind.
