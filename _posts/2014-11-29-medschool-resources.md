---

There are hundreds of resources available to help you study with new one
popping up every year, so it's important to narrow in on the best.  Here is a
short list of the best resources I used during the didactic portion of med
school.  I cover various approaches to learning: review texts, memory palaces,
video lectures, spaced repetition software, physical note cards, and more.

## Three resources every med student uses

There is no resource that will cover 100% of the NBME STEP1 exam, so you'll
pull from various sources.  Don't fall into the trap of thinking your grades
will improve if you have more resources; you'll get spread thin.  Better to
focus on knowing a few good resources thoroughly, and then picking pieces from
other resources as needed.  That said, here are three resources every medical
student uses for the boards.

### [First Aid for STEP1][First Aid]: content review for entire exam

  [First Aid]: http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&field-keywords=first%20aid%20for%20step%201&linkCode=ur2&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Afirst%20aid%20for%20step%201&tag=jgmalcolm-20&url=search-alias%3Daps&linkId=65ZSHFLD65LXYPVO

* Everything you need to know to pass STEP1.  Not a good primary learning
  tool, but an excellent outline review.
* Often referred to simply as First Aid or FA
* Every med student will purchase a copy of this.  New editions come out
  before Christmas.  This is the book you will likely spend the most time with
  in the months leading up to STEP1.
* Consolidate resources: annotate other resources (Pathoma, Firecracker, etc)
  into this so you're not spread among five review books.
* You'll definitely want a hard copy to annotate, but also a PDF version for
  text search
* Consider cutting off the binding so you can put it into a 3-ring binder for
  protection and to easily lay flat.  For each module in school, pull out only
  the relevant section.  I did this at Staples for $3, but be sure to ask them
  to slice very close to the binding, otherwise you lose some of the inner
  marginal text.

### [Pathoma](//www.pathoma.com): pathology review   {#pathoma}

   [Pathoma]: #pathoma

<figure class="thumb">
  <a href="http://google.com/trends/explore#q=pathoma%2C%20Goljan">
    <img src="/images/goljan-pathoma-trend.png"
         alt="Pathoma (blue) is overtaking Goljan (red)">
  </a>
  <figcaption>Google Trends shows Pathoma (blue) overtaking Goljan's Rapid Review Pathology (red).</figcaption>
</figure>

* Concise video lectures covering all relevant pathology along with a slim
  review text
  * About 1.5 - 2.5 hours of video per organ system
* Highly, highly recommend (you'll also see it highly recommended in First Aid
  resource recommendations appendix)
* Purchase the longest possible subscription (eg. 21 months) because you'll
  keep coming back to these videos during your modules and especially in the
  run up to STEP1.
* [Record audio] so you can listen while you commute or exercise
* Combine with [Goljan's lectures][goljan] to get multiple views of key
  topics.  Sometimes one explains it better than the other.
* There are
  [other pathology resources to pull from](#other-pathology-resources), but
  Pathoma is the best use of your time
* **During each block, watch each video three times.** Watch at 1x to learn,
  and then a week later at 1.3x or 1.7x to review, and finally once more
  before the exam.  Whenever I get tired of doing questions, popping up a
  Pathoma video is an easy step down that still keeps me productive.
* In your 1x pass, underline in your book the things Sattar emphasizes in his
  slides.  If he draws a diagram, draw it in your book's margin.  For
  subsequent passes at 1.3x and 1.7x, just sit back and absorb the slides.

### [UWorld](//www.usmleworld.com/purchase.aspx): practice questions  {#uworld}

* The official question bank of USMLE
* 2618 questions total
  * bank of 2250 questions
  * two self assessment exams (184 questions each for a total of 368 questions)
* Also known as "USMLE World"
* Explanations are of the highest quality
* various purchase options
  * Purchase about 30-90 days out from your STEP1 date
  * Organize your classmates to get a group discount
* When you hit dedicated STEP1 study time, you must do every question in this
  qbank at least once.  Many students go through twice.
* For your modules, you'll want to purchase the
  [USMLE-Rx or Kaplan qbanks][qbanks]




## Top resources many students use

The three resources above will provide the most comprehensive coverage in the
fewest number of resources.  You should be spending the majority of your
dedicated STEP1 study time focused on those three.

Beyond those, nearly all students pull from a few additional resources
throughout their coursework.  The following is a survey of resources.  Choices
depend on your weaknesses and learning style.


  [spaced repetition]: http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition

### [Firecracker](https://firecracker.me)  {#firecracker}

* Flashcard software prepoplated with STEP1 material (a combination of First
  Aid, Goljan, etc.)
* [Spaced repetition][spaced repetition] algorithm to optimize when to review
  what information
* As you cover material (daily) you add it to the question pool (flag it).
* The "practice simulations" are very low quality; stick to Rx/Kaplan/UWorld
* Learn the keyboard shortcuts (when you're doing a quiz, there's a little
  laptop icon on the bottom right)
* [Anki] is a similar and better tool for its design and feedback metrics, but
  Firecracker is better overall for medical students because it is
  prepopulated saving you hundreds of hours of reinventing the wheel by making
  your own cards or hassling with those from others.
* A big downside to Firecracker is the **lack of figures and images**:
  everything is text-based.  This makes it especially hard when it comes to
  biochemical pathways or anything in First Aid with a diagram.  Think of all
  the figures First Aid has; Firecracker has none of those.  Any figures they
  have are picked off random websites, likely to avoid copyright fees.
* While comprehensive, another downside of Firecracker is moderate quality,
  relative to some of the more highly edited resources like First Aid, UWorld,
  Kaplan, Rx, Goljan, etc.  Firecracker is written by senior students and
  residents, and as such it uses inconsistent formatting and very often
  includes extraneous detail.  I was often frustrated by what seemed like its
  focus on pedantic details.  The *spaced repetition algorithm* is absolutely
  the best strategy; however, the content of Firecracker needs improvement.
  That said, Firecracker appears to be evolving and improving faster than any
  other resources in this list.  They listen to customer feedback and daily
  make edits and improvements.
* I probably spent half of my pre-boards time in medical school learning with
  Firecracker. Read more on [how I use Firecracker][firecracker use].
* Ken Noguchi writes about [his use of Firecracker](http://sidenotelife.tumblr.com/post/88788673049/ken-explains-studying-in-med-school-a-year-long).
  The Firecracker blog has a lot of (biased?)

### [Lippincott's Microcards]   {#lippincotts-microcards}

  [microcards]: #lippincotts-microcards

  [Lippincott's Microcards]: http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&field-keywords=lippincott%20microcards&linkCode=ur2&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Alippincott%20microcards&tag=jgmalcolm-20&url=search-alias%3Daps&linkId=TQOYT6JCPI3PE5HR

<div class="gallery">
  <figure class="thumb">
    <a href="/images/micro-flashcards.jpg" data-gallery="microcards" title="Simple annotations to highlight tested facts. Think critically 'What is testable?' so you only emphasize a few things per card.">
      <img src="/images/micro-flashcards.jpg">
    </a>
    <figcaption>Simple annotations</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

* Flashcards that show a vignette, key symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and
  high yield facts.
* Covers about 140 bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, and helminths.
  Everything is relevant for STEP1.
* Underline and annotate to emphasize key facts.  As with adding to any review
  resource, be careful not to add too much.  It's okay to add a small table
  contrasting against other bugs, but be careful to not add low-yield random
  facts that will clutter the card.
* Combine these with [Sketchy Micro] or [Picmonic]


### [Sketchy Micro](http://sketchymicro.com)  {#sketchy-micro}

  [Sketchy Micro]: #sketchy-micro

* video [memory scenes] of 47 bacteria, dynamically drawn while narrated with
  teaching points
* create free account to get *Staph*, *Strep*, and *Enterococcus*, and
  [free samples on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1BRRTxAdlQCy2Tq8YfHX0w)
* $40/6mo
* Focused only on bacteria (as of Fall 2014)
* [record the audio][record audio] to listen while you commute, exercise, or
  do chores
* After the "required" First Aid, Pathoma, and UWorld, I would say that
  **Sketchy Micro was the best money I spent** on learning materials.


### [Picmonic](http://picmonic.com)  {#picmonic}

  [Picmonic]: #picmonic

* ~800 static [memory scenes] with audio tutorials
* $250 for 12 months, or $25/month
* I use this only for spot memorization (eg. pharm, vasculitides, micro,
  viral) rather than conceptual material (eg. pathophysiology)
* Whenever I hit something I have trouble recalling, I skim the picture in
  Picmonic or queue it up in a review play list.
* I only use the *Learn* feature (not *Explore* or *Quiz*)
* [record the audio][record audio]


[memory scenes]: http://www.ted.com/talks/joshua_foer_feats_of_memory_anyone_can_do




### Comparing Picmonic and Sketchy Micro

* Sketchy Micro (SM) has higher quality and more intuitive explanations than
  Picmonic (P), but Picmonic covers more topics.
* SM only bacteria, P contains everything (bacteria + viral + diseases + drugs + pathophys + more)
* SM more intuitive scenes; Picmonic can be ridiculous and make no sense, so consequently the imagery doesn't stick with me
* For me personally, watching the SM scene getting drawn is more captivating;
  P uses static scenes
* SM has simple but poorly designed navigation vs P which is overly
  complicated and buggy in a lot of cases
* both lack completeness but they provide enough to learn the basics;
  [Lippincott's Microcards][microcards] and First Aid have everything

  <div class="gallery"> <a href="/images/picmonic-vldl.png"
  data-gallery="picmonic" title="Picmonic tries to literally spell out
  everything:  'decrease VLDL synthesis' is a 'tied up veiled lady bug devil
  with liver'."> <img class="thumb"
  src="/images/picmonic-vldl.png"></a></div>
* One thing I dislike about Picmonic is how they try to literally spell out
  everything, eg. *decrease VLDL synthesis* is a *tied up veiled lady bug
  devil with liver*.  Sketchy Micro does a better job at finding more
  intuitive hooks.  On the bright side, both are consistent in their visual
  hooks, so you'll see the same fact represented using the same symbol across
  multiple scenes.


### Learn From Videos {#videos}

* YouTube is a treasure trove of focused topical videos.
  * Each module, create a playlist and add videos as you come across them.
  [Here are ones I collected](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJJNCT5F3nhtAT0vWvdGVJA/playlists).
  * Browse and subscribe to various channels and playlists out there:
    * [Armando Hasudungan](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCesNt4_Z-Pm41RzpAClfVcg)
    * [DoctorNajeeb](https://www.youtube.com/user/DoctorNajeeb/playlists)
    * [Antibiotics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYojB5NEEakWCoWLnx0F1OxY6PXVaBkVT)
  * These were especially useful for anatomy:
    * [Human Anatomy Dissections](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6F5A027100A37163)
    * [James Preddy @ U Touro Nevada](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNdgkaw0fFGRODIAe2ZiGeIE216CgIRk0)
* [Handwritten Tutorials](//handwrittentutorials.com)
  ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/harpinmartin)) - Excellent, simple
  videos of key topics in anatomy, biochem, immunology, neuroscience, pharm,
  and physiology.
* Khan Academy has been building up a great collection of videos in [biology],
  [cells], [cellular respiration], [immunology], [human biology],
  [physiology], and more.
* [Teddy Has An Operation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdYaTa_lOf4) for
  those interested in going into surgical specialties

## How I use Firecracker  {#how-i-use-firecracker}

  [firecracker use]: #how-i-use-firecracker

### When you fall behind

Sometimes I fall behind and the question load can be overwhelming.  Here are
some strategies:

* **Put in the time.** There's no substitute to just putting in the time.
  Glancing at the info and rating it a 1 is better than ignoring it forever.
  Try to just remember one bit of info and then move on.
* **Do Fewer questions.** Narrow the scope of a quiz.  Otherwise, you might
  feel like you're getting punched from every direction as random topics hit
  you.
  * Above the calendar, click "More Options" > "Do Fewer Questions".
* **Spread out questions.** Spread over the coming days/weeks.
  * You can only spread Review and Catchup questions (not Study).
  * Above the calendar, click "More Options" > "Spread Out Questions".
* **Switch to Normal Mode.** Focus on a smaller set of the highest yield
  material.
  * *Normal* mode contains about half the number of questions.
  * You still get the benefit of reviewing topics according to how strong you
    are, and you can always take a moment to review the full topic and all its
    sub-topic details that you might have been tested on in *Legendary Mode*.
  * To switch learning modes, click the doctor icon in the top-right >
    "Account & Settings" > "Settings" > "Normal Mode" (default is "Legendary")
  * Your flagged topics, notes, and history will all remain.
  * In the months **leading up to STEP1, I switched to Normal mode** so I
    could hit the high points but start spending more time with qbanks and
    other resources.
* **Check STEP1 only.** No need to include STEP2 (3rd year) questions.
  There's a lot of overlapping coverage and you'll be fine with just STEP1.
  This is also under "Account & Settings".
* **Uncheck topics covered better elsewhere.** Pathoma is better at pathology
  than Firecracker, so I ended up un-checking many of these topics
  post-module.  Physiology was also another item I unchecked.  Firecracker was
  best at brute memorization of micro and pharm.


### Long term value proposition

The real value of Firecracker comes after months of use.  It surprised me how
much I retained from past modules because Firecracker forced me to touch on
things now and then.  I'd say that half its value can be realized for learning
in your present module, but half its value is longitudinal over all your
blocks.  Put in the time to review old material.

### Put in the time

There are no short cuts to simply putting in the time to actually learn.
Merely owning Firecracker or any resource won't make you a better student.
The hard reality is that you have to put in the time.

With Firecracker, there's a lot of upfront work of slogging through questions
before you start to reach steady state maintenance mode.  As long as you're
flagging new topics a few times a week (as you're going through new material),
it'll be a battle to keep that number down.

You need to spend time on weekends and vacations chipping away at questions,
or they pile up.



# Question Banks  {#question-banks}

  [qbanks]: #question-banks

[USMLE World](#uworld) is the best choice for STEP1 dedicated study, but you
want to save it until that time.  Throughout the year and even at the start of
your dedicated study period, you'll want to work through either of the
following standard question banks.

Until you get close to STEP1, **do questions in *Un-timed Tutor Mode***.  This
allows you to take your time, look up things if you choose, and get immediate
feedback.  When you get a few weeks out from STEP1, then you want to do timed
tests to work in endurance and pacing.  Several times I accidentally created
blocks that were timed; Rx lets you delete them from the web interface, but
you have to email Kaplan to delete these tests.


## [USMLE-Rx Qmax](https://www.usmle-rx.com/content/step-1-qmax)

* 2524 total questions
* Written by the authors of First Aid, answer explanations show pages from
  First Aid so consider this a companion qbank
* 12mo subscription is $149 with [$50 discount](https://www.usmle-rx.com/amsa)
  after free
  [AMSA membership](http://www.amsa.org/AMSA/Homepage/MemberCenter/JoinAMSA.aspx)
  (regularly $199)

## [Kaplan](http://www.kaptest.com/Medical-Licensing/Step1/s1-qbank.html)

* 2006 total questions
* $210 with AMA membership ($20) for a total of $230
   * regularly $300 without AMA membership)
* answer explanations contain links to video and other media, as well as scans
  from pages in [medEssentials for USMLE Step 1][medEssentials]
* terrible customer support

## Comparing Kaplan and USMLE-Rx

* **Kaplan has the best explanations. Rx is more straight forward for learning
  First Aid.**
  * Kaplan's explanations tend to teach broad lessons about the question
    topic, including details and links to
    [medEssentials for USMLE STEP1][medEssentials], occasional videos, and
    better explanations of why answers were wrong relative to the correct
    answer.  Best of all, Kaplan often takes the opportunity to review a
    larger portion of the relevant pathophysiology.  Rx tends to just state
    facts relevant to the immediate question.  Don't skip the Kaplan "ReKaps &
    Refs"; they're golden.
  * Kaplan often seems pedantic, uses descriptive terms not in First Aid, and
    uses images of histology/culture that look very different from First Aid.
    **Kaplan is simply harder than Rx**, so if you get good at Kaplan, you'll
    probably know the material nuances better than with Rx.  I found my Kaplan
    scores slightly lower than my Rx scores, but **I always felt like I knew
    the material better after Kaplan**.  Read another student's
    [review on Kaplan](http://forums.studentdoctor.net/threads/just-finished-kaplan-qbank-my-brief-thoughts-on-it.943957/)
  * Kaplan regularly uses second-order questions, and some are even
    third-order.  Rarely will you find a straight recall question in Kaplan
    (first-order).  In contrast, Rx is full of first- and second-order
    questions, but no third-order.  In this way, one Kaplan question covers
    2-3 layers of information while an Rx question only covers 1-2.
  * Rx ties directly into FA (the explanations literally show you the relevant
    FA pages).  Use it as a way to learn FA, but it's lacking those broad
    lessons that Kaplan explanations often emphasize.
  * Both provide about the same level of post-test analysis, but Kaplan shows
    you a few extra columns indicating time spent and which answer you
    switched.
* **Rx has a better user interface.**
  * Rx is a clear winner here: smooth web interface (HTML), but poor iOS app.
  * Kaplan has a terrible interface (Flash) and even worse iOS app.

Ultimately, I ended up using both qbanks a lot because I found it great to see
information from multiple perspectives.  I used Rx mostly during the school
year to learn FA, and I used Kaplan mostly during the dedicated STEP1 study
period before switching to UWorld.  Whenever pressed for time, I used the
Kaplan bank to cover more material per question.

## [First Aid Q&A for USMLE Step 1]

  [First Aid Q&A for USMLE Step 1]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0071744029/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0071744029&linkCode=as2&tag=jgmalcolm-20&linkId=QRNMRPTNGRDQXWFL

* 1000 questions organized into basic principles and organ systems, plus a
  full length exam.
* Consider buying a paper-based question bank because sometimes it's nice to
  study without your computer or outside on a sunny day.
* I've found maybe 10% of these questions duplicated in USMLE-Rx Qmax
* I sometimes use these as throwaway [pretest questions][pretesting] early on
  in a module to "prime" my brain for key concepts to be on the lookout for.
* Much like USMLE-Rx, but great for when you want to put your computer aside
  and knock out extra questions.

[pretesting]: http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/magazine/why-flunking-exams-is-actually-a-good-thing.html




## Other pathology resources

* [BRS Pathology]
  * Concise and well-organized review
  * Simpler than Pathoma
  * Each chapter has about 20 solid questions
* Goljan's [Rapid Review Pathology]
  * The same topic sequence as Pathoma but much more detail, especially when
    it comes to microbiology, but not as much as [Robbins & Cotran] (aka "The
    Bible of Pathology", get this if you're interested in Pathology as a
    residency).
  * Further on in the curriculum, I realized I wanted more details and a
    alternative view on pathology so I started skimming chapters from this but
    Pathoma is sufficient for a good foundation.
  * The first edition of this text is what his [audio lectures][goljan] are
    based on

If you had to rank order the complexity of these resources: BRS < Pathoma <
Goljan's < Robbins & Cotran.  Pathoma is more than enough for STEP1.

[Robbins & Cotran]: http://www.amazon.com/dp/1455726133
[Rapid Review Pathology]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0323087876/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0323087876&linkCode=as2&tag=jgmalcolm-20&linkId=W27RBR7TKB2ATXIM

[BRS Physiology]: http://www.amazon.com/dp/0781798760

## Goljan STEP1 audio   {#goljan-step1-audio}

  [goljan]: #goljan-step1-audio

* A series of lectures as part of a boards review course he conducted
* These lectures were delivered with the first edition of
  [Rapid Review Pathology] text, but you can still follow along in the latest
  edition.  The slides and a scan of the original textbook can be found
  online.
* Full of board pearls since he helps edit the USMLE questions.  While most of
  the pathognomonic stuff is outdated and boards questions rarely use such
  classic tip-offs, the concepts are still valid and tested in similar ways
* It's not well organized, but makes for good background listening while
  running errands, doing chores, or exercising.
* Pathoma is more updated, organized, and focused, so use Pathoma if you had
  to pick one or the other




## [Anki](http://ankisrs.net)  {#anki}

   [anki]: #anki

* Good but you have to spend time populating versus Firecracker which is
  prepopulated
* Good for hot spot memorization of tables/charts (eg. drugs, cytokines,
  vitamins) but not recommended for general use since pre-populated resources
  exist
* Excellent advice on how to make the best cards:
  [Anki: 10,000 cards later](http://rs.io/2014/04/05/anki-10000-cards-later.html)
  and
  [20 Rules of Formulating Knowledge](http://www.supermemo.com/articles/20rules.htm).
* Some prepopulated [decks](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/3641619405)
  [already](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1656465381)
  [exist](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2445310057) for the
  ["Rapid Review" tables](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1014441642) in First
  Aid
* Lacks good methods for sharing/updating decks with classmates
* Better graphs than Firecracker to chart progress
* Note bene: Everyone I know who used this eventually abandoned because of
  time involved in creating and curating decks


## [First Aid Basic Sciences]

* A companion to First Aid for STEP1, but this is a learning tool.
* Covers all basic science in First Aid, but is due for an update compared to FA.
* You could probably get buy purchasing this instead of the random specialized
  and overly-detailed books that professors recommend.  The exception is
  Lilly's [Pathophysiology of Heart Disease][Lilly], an absolutely fantastic
  text for your cardiology module.

[Lilly]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1605477230/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1605477230&linkCode=as2&tag=jgmalcolm-20&linkId=PMW3LS2CV3N2VRDV



# Anatomy

* [Netter] is the gold standard and has all the classic diagrams you'll see in
  lectures, eg. cervical plexus.  [Atlas of Anatomy 2e] is also great, but
  probably best to stick with Netter.
* To learn anatomy, skip anatomy lectures.  They go too fast to actually
  learn.  Instead drill with [Netter Flashcards] and [online videos](#videos)
  so you can pause and memorize as needed.  For each exam, put all the
  relevant cards on the ring and flip through those as you can.
* Buy the recommended Clemente dissector and Netter atlas, same edition
  recommended. This way you match the lecture slide references.
   * As a table, buy two dissectors and two atlases to leave in the lab.
   * Personally buy Netter for home study (keep it for life).
   * Consider getting a second copy of the dissector for personal prep (not a
     gooey lab copy)
* Only buy two (2) dissecting kits for your entire table and share. Make sure
  you have two of everything: scalpel, small & large scissors, small & large
  hemostats, small & large toothed & non-toothed tweezers (pickups).
* Consider buying your own
  [fresh lab coat](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0072IHTIO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0072IHTIO&linkCode=as2&tag=jgmalcolm-20&linkId=SYCNZHTAV32IKRGV)
  instead of using the stained used ones. Write your name prominently on the
  collar or front. Personalize as inspired.
* Buy
  [thick multi-colored friendship bracelet string](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CE8J9C/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001CE8J9C&linkCode=as2&tag=jgmalcolm-20&linkId=57VJNMQMWTKABLL2)
  to tag arteries, veins, nerves, muscle, etc. Regular sewing thread is too
  thin and you'll want multiple colors.  Keep it in a ziplock bag.

# Recording audio from video  {#record-audio}

  [record audio]: #record-audio

As I watched [Pathoma], [Sketchy Micro], and [Picmonic], I recorded the audio
to mp3 so that I could listen to it while commuting, exercising, or doing
chores.  While lacking the visual experience it's a way to eek out a little
extra learning as you exercise your visual recall.  The audio will make little
sense unless you've spent time watching the videos to pick up the mental
imagery.

* Install [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net) to record and export audio
* Install [Soundflower](https://code.google.com/p/soundflower/downloads/list)
  to channel audio from your browser to Audacity

For listening on the go, I recommend [Jarv NMotion Sport Wireless Bluetooth]
headset.  They're inexpensive and it's super convenient to not have cords
getting tangled while you're on the go.  For listening at your computer, I
recommend [Audéo earbuds] - expensive, but excellent quality and snug fit.

  [Audéo earbuds]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003V9QDXK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B003V9QDXK&linkCode=as2&tag=jgmalcolm-20&linkId=MDT4Q76B4IQOY4BF

### Record settings

* [Screenshots showing the process][wikihow]
* Audacity
  * Set the microphone to Soundflower (2ch), Mono
* Enable 'Sound activated recording' so you won't have to start/stop/trim;
  it'll just start when the video starts, and stop when the video stops.
  * Audacity: Preferences > Recording > enable 'Sound activated recording'

### MP3 export settings

* How I name MP3s from each service (ID3 info): Artist / Album / Track
  * Pathoma / chapter / topic
  * SketchyMicro / bug group / bug
  * Picmonic / organ system play list / vignette
* Encoding settings
  * Install either LAME or FFmpeg
  * 22 KHz sampling, (fast) variable 65-105 kbps, mono
  * [advanced details][mp3 settings]

<img class="thumb" src="/images/soundflower.png" alt="Ensure Built-in Output
  is checked"> Sometimes when I pull my headphones out, this setup gets in a
  weird state where I have no sound.  When this happens, ensure the
  Soundflower icon in menu bar is set for 2ch output to be "Built-in Output".
  Usually this fixes the situation.
