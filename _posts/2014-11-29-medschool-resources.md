description: "A survey of the top study resources for the first two years of med school."
---

There are a hundreds resources available to help you study, and new ones pop
up every year.  I'm not going to even try to catalog them all.  This is a
short list of the resources I used during the didactic portion of med school.
I've experimented with various channels for learning: review texts, memory
palaces, video tutorials, spaced repetition software, physical note cards, and
more.

## Three resources every med student uses

There is no resource that will cover 100% of the NBME STEP1 exam, so you'll
pull from various sources.  Don't fall into the trap of thinking your grades
will improve if you have more resources; you'll get spread thin.  Better to
focus on knowing a few good resources thoroughly, and then picking pieces from
other resources as needed.  That said, here are three resources every medical
student uses for the boards.

### [First Aid for STEP1][First Aid]: content review for entire exam

  [First Aid]: http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&field-keywords=first%20aid%20for%20step%201&linkCode=ur2&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Afirst%20aid%20for%20step%201&tag=jgmalcolm-20&url=search-alias%3Daps&linkId=65ZSHFLD65LXYPVO

* Everything you need to know to pass STEP1.  Not a good primary learning
  tool, but an excellent outline review.
* Often referred to simply as First Aid or FA
* Every med student will purchase a copy of this.  New editions come out
  before Christmas.  This is the book you will likely spend the most time with
  in the months leading up to STEP1.
* Consolidate resources: annotate other resources (Pathoma, Firecracker, etc)
  into this so you're not spread among five review books.
* You'll definitely want a hard copy to annotate, but also a PDF version for
  text search

### [Pathoma](//www.pathoma.com): pathology review

* Concise video lectures covering all relevant pathology along with a slim
  review text
  * About 1.5 - 2.5 hours of video per organ system
* Highly, highly recommend (you'll also see it highly recommended in First Aid
  resource recommendations appendix)
* Purchase 21 months out from your STEP1 exam date
* Interesting to that
  [Google Trends](//google.com/trends/explore#q=pathoma%2C%20Goljan) shows
  Pathoma (blue) overtaking Goljan's [Rapid Review Pathology] (red).  <img
  src="/images/goljan-pathoma-trend.png" class="thumb" alt="Pathoma (blue) is
  overtaking Goljan (red)">
* [Record audio] so you can listen while you commute or exercise
* Combine with [Goljan's lectures][goljan] to get multiple views of key
  topics.  Sometimes one explains it better than the other.
* There are
  [other pathology resources to pull from](#other-pathology-resources), but
  Pathoma is the best use of your time

### [U-World](//www.usmleworld.com/purchase.aspx): practice questions

* The official question bank of USMLE
* Also known as "USMLE World"
* Explanations are of the highest quality
* $250 for question bank and self-assessments
  * Purchase about 90 days out from your STEP1 date
  * Organize your classmates to get a group discount
* When you hit dedicated STEP1 study time, you must do every question in this
  qbank at least once.  Many students go through twice.
* For your modules, you'll want to purchase the
  [USMLE-Rx or Kaplan qbanks][qbanks]




## Top resources many students use

The three resources above will provide the most comprehensive coverage in the
fewest number of resources.  That said, nearly all students pull from a few
additional resources.  The following is a survey of resources for the main
areas of study.  Choices depend on your weaknesses and learning style.


  [spaced repetition]: http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition

### [Firecracker](https://firecracker.me)

* I probably spent half of my time in medical school learning with
  Firecracker.
* Flashcard software prepoplated with STEP1 material (a combination of First
  Aid, Goljan, etc.)
* [Spaced repetition][spaced repetition] algorithm to optimize when to review
  what information
* As you cover material (daily/weekly) you add it to the question pool (flag
  it)
* The "practice simulations" are very low quality; stick to Rx/Kaplan/UWorld
* Use the keyboard shortcuts (when you're doing a quiz, there's a little
  laptop icon on the bottom right)
* Anki is a similar and better tool for its design and feedback metrics, but
  Firecracker is better overall for medical students because it is
  prepopulated saving you hundreds of hours of reinventing the wheel by making
  your own cards or hassling with those from others.
* Read more on [how I use Firecracker][firecracker use].



### [Lippincott's Microcards]

  [microcards]: #lippincotts-microcards

  [Lippincott's Microcards]: http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&field-keywords=lippincott%20microcards&linkCode=ur2&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Alippincott%20microcards&tag=jgmalcolm-20&url=search-alias%3Daps&linkId=TQOYT6JCPI3PE5HR

<div class="gallery"> <a href="/images/micro-flashcards.jpg"
  data-gallery="wiki" title="Simple annotations to highlight tested facts.
  Think critically 'What is testable?' so you only emphasize a few things per
  card."> <img class="thumb" src="/images/micro-flashcards.jpg"></a></div>

* Flashcards that show a vignette, key symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and
  high yield facts.
* Covers about 140 bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, and helminths.
* You can underline and annotate key facts.  As with annotating any boards
  review source, be careful not to add too much.  It's okay to add a small
  table contrasting against other bugs, but be careful to not add low-yield
  random facts that will clutter the card.
* Combine these with [Sketchy Micro] or [Picmonic]



### [Picmonic](http://picmonic.com)

  [Picmonic]: #picmonic

* static [memory scenes] with audio guide
* $250 for 12 months, or $25/month
* I use this only for spot treatment of various drugs and diseases that often
  times just require brute memorization (eg. pharm, vasculitides) rather than
  conceptual material (eg. pathophysiology of systems)
* Whenever I hit something I have trouble recalling, I skim the picture in
  Picmonic or queue it up in a review play list.
* I only use the Learn feature (not the Explore or other)
* [record the audio][record audio]


### [Sketchy Micro](http://sketchymicro.com)

  [Sketchy Micro]: #sketchy-micro

* video [memory scenes] of 47 bacteria
* create free account to get: S aureus, S epidermidis, S saprophyticus, S
  pyogenes, S agalactiae, S pneumoniae, Strep viridans, Enterococcus, and
  [free samples on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1BRRTxAdlQCy2Tq8YfHX0w)
* $40/6mo
* Focused only on bacteria (as of Fall 2014)
* Compared to Picmonic:
   * Overall higher quality and better explanations
   * only bacteria (Picmonic: bacteria + viral + diseases + drugs + pathophys + more)
   * more intuitive scenes (Picmonic can be ridiculous and make no sense)
   * for me, watching the scene getting drawn is more captivating (Picmonic: static scene)
   * cheaper ($7/mo versus $25/mo for Picmonic)
   * simple but poor navigation vs Picmonic which is overly complicated and
     buggy in a lot of cases
   * both lack completeness, but Picmonic seems to have a few more important
     details ([Lippincott's Microcards][microcards] are more comprehensive)
* [record the audio][record audio] to listen while you commute, exercise, or
  do chores

[memory scenes]: http://www.ted.com/talks/joshua_foer_feats_of_memory_anyone_can_do






### Learn From Videos

* YouTube is a treasure trove of focused topical videos.
  * Each module, create a playlist and add videos as you come across them.
  [Here are ones I collected](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJJNCT5F3nhtAT0vWvdGVJA/playlists).
  * Browse and subscribe to various channels and playlists out there:
    * [DoctorNajeeb](https://www.youtube.com/user/DoctorNajeeb/playlists) covers
    * [Antibiotics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYojB5NEEakWCoWLnx0F1OxY6PXVaBkVT)
    * [Human Anatomy Dissections](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6F5A027100A37163)
* [Handwritten Tutorials](//handwrittentutorials.com)
  ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/harpinmartin)) - Excellent, simple
  videos of key topics in anatomy, biochem, immunology, neuroscience, pharm,
  and physiology.
* Khan Academy has been building up a great collection of videos in [biology],
  [cells], [cellular respiration], [immunology], [human biology],
  [physiology], and more.
* [Teddy Has An Operation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdYaTa_lOf4) for
  those interested in going into surgical specialties

## How I use Firecracker

  [firecracker use]: #how-i-use-firecracker

### When you fall behind

Sometimes I fall behind and the question load can be overwhelming.  Here are
some strategies:

* **Put in the time.** There's no substitute to just putting in the time.
  Glancing at the info and rating it a 1 is better than ignoring it forever.
  Try to just remember one bit of info and then move on.
* **Do Fewer questions.** and focus on a few topics.  Otherwise, you might
  feel like you're getting punched from every direction as random topics hit
  you.
  * Above the calendar, click "More Options" > "Do Fewer Questions".
* **Spread out questions.** over the coming days/weeks.
  * You can only spread Review and Catchup questions (not Study).
  * Above the calendar, click "More Options" > "Spread Out Questions".
* **Switch to Normal Mode.** to focus on a smaller set of the highest yield
  material.
  * Normal mode contains about half the number of questions.
  * You still get the benefit of reviewing topics according to how strong you
    are, and you can always take a moment to review the full topic and all its
    sub-topic details that you might have been tested on in Legendary Mode.
  * To switch learning modes, click the doctor icon in the top-right >
    "Account & Settings" > "Settings" > "Normal Mode" (default is "Legendary")
  * Your flagged topics, notes, and history will all remain.
  * In the months *leading up to STEP1, I switched to Normal mode* so I could
    hit the high points but start spending more time with Qbanks and other
    resources.
* **Check STEP1 only.** No need to include STEP2 (3rd year) questions.
  There's a lot of overlapping coverage and you'll be fine with just STEP1.
  This is also under "Account & Settings".
* **Uncheck topics covered better elsewhere.** Pathoma is better at pathology
  than Firecracker, so I ended up un-checking many of these topics
  post-module.  Physiology was also another item I unchecked.  Firecracker was
  best at brute memorization of micro and pharm.


### Long term value proposition

The real value of Firecracker comes after months of use.  It surprised me how
much I retained from past modules because Firecracker forced me to touch on
things now and then.  I'd say that half its value can be realized for learning
in your present module, but half its value is longitudinal over all your
blocks.  Put in the time to review old material.

### There's no short cut

You have to put in the time to actually learn.  Merely owning Firecracker or
any resource won't make you a better student.  The hard reality is that you
have to put in the time.

With Firecracker, there's a lot of upfront work of slogging through questions
before you start to reach steady state maintenance mode.  As long as you're
flagging new topics a few times a week (as you're going through new material),
it'll be a battle to keep that number down.

You need to spend time on weekends and vacations chipping away at questions,
or they pile up.



# Question Banks

  [qbanks]: #question-banks

USMLE World is the best choice for STEP1 dedicated study, but throughout the
year and even at the start of your dedicated study period, you'll want to work
through either of the following standard question banks.

## [USMLE-Rx Qmax](https://www.usmle-rx.com/content/step-1-qmax)

* 2524 total questions
* Written by the authors of First Aid, follows very closely
* 12mo subscription is $149 with [$50 discount](https://www.usmle-rx.com/amsa)
  after free
  [AMSA membership](http://www.amsa.org/AMSA/Homepage/MemberCenter/JoinAMSA.aspx)
  (regularly $199)

## [Kaplan](http://www.kaptest.com/Medical-Licensing/Step1/s1-qbank.html)

* 2006 total questions
* $210 with AMA membership ($20) for a total of $230
   * regularly $300 without AMA membership)

## Comparing Kaplan and USMLE-Rx

* It's hard to say which is better
  * Kaplan has very thorough (better) explanations, but often too detailed.
    That said, if you get good at Kaplan, you'll probably know the material
    nuances better than with Rx.
  * Rx ties directly into FA (the explanations literally show you the relevant
    FA pages).  Use it as a way to learn FA and then move on to UWorld.
* User interface: Rx is a clear winner
  * Rx has an excellent, smooth web interface (HTML), poor iOS app
  * Kaplan has a terrible interface (Flash) and even worse iOS app


## [First Aid Q&A for USMLE Step 1]

  [First Aid Q&A for USMLE Step 1]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0071744029/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0071744029&linkCode=as2&tag=jgmalcolm-20&linkId=QRNMRPTNGRDQXWFL

* 1000 questions organized into basic principles and organ systems, plus a
  full length exam.
* Consider buying a paper-based question bank because sometimes it's nice to
  study without your computer or outside on a sunny day.
* I've found only a couple of questions duplicated in USMLE-Rx Qmax
* I sometimes use these as throwaway [pretest questions][pretesting] early on
  in a module to "prime" my brain for key concepts to be on the lookout for.
* Much like USMLE-Rx, but great for when you want to put your computer aside
  and knock out extra questions.

[pretesting]: http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/magazine/why-flunking-exams-is-actually-a-good-thing.html




## Other pathology resources

* [BRS Pathology]
  * Concise and well-organized review
  * Simpler than Pathoma
  * Each chapter has about 20 solid questions
* Goljan's [Rapid Review Pathology]
  * The same topic sequence as Pathoma but much more detail, especially when
    it comes to microbiology, but not as much as [Robbins & Cotran] (aka "The
    Bible of Pathology", get this if you're interested in Pathology as a
    residency).
  * Further on in the curriculum, I realized I wanted more details and a
    alternative view on pathology so I started skimming chapters from this but
    Pathoma is sufficient for a good foundation.
  * The first edition of this text is what his [audio lectures][goljan] are
    based on

If you had to rank order the complexity of these resources: BRS < Pathoma <
Goljan's < Robbins & Cotran.  Pathoma is more than enough for STEP1.

[Robbins & Cotran]: http://www.amazon.com/dp/1455726133
[Rapid Review Pathology]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0323087876/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0323087876&linkCode=as2&tag=jgmalcolm-20&linkId=W27RBR7TKB2ATXIM
[BRS Pathology]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1451115873/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1451115873&linkCode=as2&tag=jgmalcolm-20&linkId=A3ED6I7JXGH55IUM
[BRS Physiology]: http://www.amazon.com/dp/0781798760

## Goljan STEP1 audio

  [goljan]: #goljan-step1-audio

* A series of lectures as part of a boards review course he conducted
* These lectures were delivered with the first edition of
  [Rapid Review Pathology] text, but you can still follow along in the latest
  edition.  The slides and a scan of the original textbook can be found
  online.
* Full of board pearls since he helps edit the USMLE questions.  While most of
  the pathognomonic stuff is outdated and boards questions rarely use such
  classic tip-offs, the concepts are still valid and tested in similar ways
* It's not well organized, but makes for good background listening while
  running errands, doing chores, or exercising.
* Pathoma is more updated, organized, and focused, so use Pathoma if you had
  to pick one or the other




## [Anki](http://ankisrs.net)

* Good but you have to spend time populating versus Firecracker which is
  prepopulated
* Good for hot spot memorization of tables/charts (eg. drugs, cytokines,
  vitamins) but not recommended for general use since pre-populated resources
  exist
* Some prepopulated [decks](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/3641619405)
  [already](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1656465381)
  [exist](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2445310057) for the "Rapid Review"
  tables in First Aid
* Lacks good methods for sharing/updating decks with classmates
* Better graphs than Firecracker to chart progress
* Note bene: Everyone I know who used this eventually abandoned because of
  time involved in creating and curating decks


## [First Aid Basic Sciences]

* A companion to First Aid for STEP1, but this is a learning tool.
* Covers all basic science in First Aid, but is due for an update compared to FA.
* You could probably get buy purchasing this instead of the random specialized
  and overly-detailed books that professors recommend.  The exception is
  Lilly's [Pathophysiology of Heart Disease][Lilly], an absolutely fantastic
  text for your cardiology module.

[First Aid Basic Sciences]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0071785744/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0071785744&linkCode=as2&tag=jgmalcolm-20&linkId=7CLFIS3XQTFUNYJW
[Lilly]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1605477230/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1605477230&linkCode=as2&tag=jgmalcolm-20&linkId=PMW3LS2CV3N2VRDV



# Anatomy

* [Netter] is the gold standard and has all the classic diagrams you'll see in
  lectures, eg. cervical plexus.  [Atlas of Anatomy 2e] is also great, but
  probably best to stick with Netter.
* [Netter Flashcards] are the best way to learn.  For each module, put all the
  relevant cards on the ring and flip through those as you can.
* Buy the recommended Clemente dissector and Netter atlas, same edition
  recommended. This way you match the lecture slide references.
   * As a table, buy two dissectors and two atlases to leave in the lab.
   * Personally buy Netter for home study (keep it for life).
   * Consider getting a second copy of the dissector for personal prep (not a
     gooey lab copy)
* Only buy two (2) dissecting kits for your entire table and share. Make sure
  you have two of everything: scalpel, small & large scissors, small & large
  hemostats, small & large toothed & non-toothed tweezers (pickups).
* Consider buying your own fresh lab coat instead of using the stained used
  ones. Write your name prominently on the collar or front. Personalize as
  inspired.
* Buy thick multi-colored friendship bracelet string to tag arteries, veins,
  nerves, muscle, etc. Regular sewing thread is too thin and you'll want
  multiple colors.  Keep it in a ziplock bag.

  [Netter]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1455704180/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1455704180&linkCode=as2&tag=jgmalcolm-20&linkId=MBQR5BOPKEMNCZH4

# Recording audio from video

  [record audio]: #recording-audio-from-video

For Pathoma and SketchyMicro, I recorded the audio to mp3 so that I could
listen to it while commuting or exercising.  While lacking the visual learning
experience it's a way to eek out a little extra learning, but keep in mind
that it's not as engaging or valuable as watching the videos to pick up the
mental imagery.

* Install [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net) to record and export audio
* Install [Soundflower](https://code.google.com/p/soundflower/downloads/list)
  to channel audio from your browser to Audacity

* Record settings
  * [Screenshots showing the process][wikihow]
  * Audacity
    * Set the microphone to Soundflower (2ch), Mono
  * Enable 'Sound activated recording' so you won't have to start/stop/trim;
    it'll just start when the video starts, and stop when the video stops.
    * Audacity: Preferences > Recording > enable 'Sound activated recording'
* MP3 export settings
  * How I name MP3s from each service (ID3 info): Artist / Album / Track
    * Pathoma / chapter / topic
    * SketchyMicro / bug group / bug
    * Picmonic / organ system play list / vignette
  * Encoding settings
    * Install either LAME or FFmpeg
    * 22 KHz sampling, (fast) variable 65-105 kbps, mono
    * [advanced details][mp3 settings]

<img class="thumb" src="/images/soundflower.png" alt="Ensure Built-in Output
  is checked"> Sometimes when I pull my headphones out, this setup gets in a
  weird state where I have no sound.  When this happens, ensure the
  Soundflower icon in menu bar is set for 2ch output to be "Built-in Output".
  Usually this fixes the situation.
