## Studying takes energy

It's often obvious what needs to be done and how best to do it.  Sometimes all
that's really needed is the energy (and motivation) to carry through.  So part
of studying is managing your energy.

It takes a long time to truly build up the discipline and tolerance to sustain
consistent long hours for days on end.  As you stretch yourself, you will do a
lot of studying when you really don't want to.  It's critical you figure out
ways to manage your energy and stretch your [willpower][willpower].

Does your mind wandering while studying a diagram or memorizing a table?
Recopy it by hand multiple times.  It requires only determination to keep
copying while you're brain is (mostly) on autopilot.  I'm always amazed at how
effective this can be.  I usually pull this out when I've repeatedly gotten a
topic wrong, and I just channel that frustration into recopying a diagram or
table.  Each iteration, add a new detail to the diagram, simplify a part you
already know, go faster.

**Break the problem down into easier pieces.** Is the entire combined
glycolytic, TCA, Urea pathway too daunting?  Then just pick one to redraw for
now.  Work on another later.  Similarly, if you're getting worn down with full
blocks of 46 questions, do smaller blocks so you get more immediate feedback.
If your worn down by low performance, smaller blocks might show an actual
score improvement for some positive feedback to keep you motivated.

**Switch tactics to boost energy.** If you're getting bored of answering
questions, switch over to watch a video lecture.

**Optimize your procrastination equation.** What's keeping you from doing what
you know you need to be doing?  Do you not think the pay off is worth it?  The
payoff is too far away?  The energy required is too much?  Whatever it is,
figure out a way to optimize that part of the
[procrastination equation][procrastination].

## Personal traps

Here are personal mistakes I've struggled against.

**Glossing over big words.** I have a tendency to gloss over big words which
leaves it all a blur.  For example, I might come across this sentence from
biochemistry:  "Phenylketonuria is due to a decrease in phenylalanine
hydroxylase or decreased tetrahydrobiopterin cofactor".  I would wrongly gloss
over the unfamiliar words, so I end up reading something more like "Phenyl---
is due to a decrease in phenyl--- --- or decreased --- cofactor".  It's no
wonder that a lot of biochemistry was just a blur to me.  I now to force
myself to slow down and parse every syllable, and slowly those hard words have
become more natural.

**Doing what's easiest.** Passively reading and nodding along because it all
seems familiar and I believe I know the material.  The harder road is to
actively do questions that test recall.  If material looks familiar but you're
having trouble recalling details necessary to answer questions, then you can
probably blame passive review.  As a corollary, with so many topics to study,
I often found myself avoiding some daunting topic by distracting myself with
more interesting (easier) topics.  Thinking about the
[procrastination equation][procrastination] often helped me find a way out of
the situation.

**Punting down field.** Often when I was going through question banks, tired,
and hit a topic I didn't know, I would mark the question and just tell myself
I'd come back to study it later.  The truth: I never would come back.  Fix:
Study the material immediately while the emotion of a wrong answer is still
present and you've got the question context in mind.  If you're too tired to
study the explanations, then you're too tired to do questions.  Either pack it
in, take a break, or switch to something else like watching Pathoma videos,
but don't get in the habit of telling yourself you'll do it tomorrow.
Tomorrow is always a day away.

**Tunnel vision.** When a patient has presents with systems involving multiple
systems (renal, muscular, pulmonary), I tended to mistakenly jump at answer
choices that might explain one or two findings perfectly, but ultimately
didn't explain all the physical exam or lab findings.  Now I know my answer
choices need to [account for every abnormal finding][abnormal-findings].
There are no wasted words in these vignettes.

**Going too fast.** The more [practice questions][qbanks] I did, the quicker I
would get, but I also got sloppy.  When I noticed myself not improving and
making stupid mistakes, I had to slow myself down.  Read.  Slower.

  [abnormal-findings]: {% post_url 2014-09-29-tactical-test-taking-skills %}#abnormal-findings


**Mistaking 'activity' for 'active learning'.** I often caught myself writing
everything down furiously so I can study it later.  The truth is, you'll
always be busy and never return to sort out the material.  This is a form of
autopilot, passive learning.  Always think critically about information
instead of just passively transcribing.





## Organize information the way it gets tested

Questions typically present a clinical vignette with chief complaint and then
some secondary information to narrow down the diagnosis.

For example, consider a patient presenting with osteomyelitis.  With no clues,
*S aureus* is most likely overall, but the vignette will likely give some
history or physical exam findings that point to other causes.  You want to put
to put together a table like the following.

| Clue | Cause
|-
| none | *S aureus*
| Sexually active | septic arthritis, *Neisseria gonorrhea*
| Sickle cell | *Salmonella*
| Diabetic | *Pseudomonas*
| Prosthetic joint | *S aureus* > *S epidermidis*
| Vertebra | *M tuberculosis*
| Cat/Dog bite | *Pasteurella*

{% comment %}
| Fracture of humerus | Nerve | Function | Sensation
|-
| Surgical neck | axillary | abduction | lateral arm
| mid-shaft | radial (musculospiral groove) | wrist drop | dorsal
| lateral epicondyle | radial | wrist drop | dorsal
| medial epicondyle | ulnar | claw hand (radial dominance)
{% endcomment %}


**Make your own tables.** Don't simply reply on those in your textbooks or
First Aid.  Work out your own versions that start out simpler and only list
and compare one or two of the most important features.

Some dimensions you can compare and contrast along:

- epidemiology
  - younger or older patients?
  - risk factors: sex, drugs, smoking
- onset
  - slow, insidious, progressive
  - acute, emergent
  - congenital, shortly after birth


**Look for contrasts to distinguish diseases.**

* Pernicious anemia (autoimmune destruction) vs. B12 insufficiency (diet)
* Follicular adenoma (encapsulated) vs. follicular carcinoma (capsular breech)
* 21-beta-hydroxylase (hypotensive) vs. 11-beta-hydroxylase (hypertensive)
* Liddle's Syndrome (hypokalemia) vs. Georges Syndrome (hyperkalemia)
* Thalassemia (defective synthesis of globin) vs. Sickle Cell (defective
  structure of globin)



## To type or write?

Typing is fast.  Writing is slow, but it forces you to think critically about
what's important to record.

Typing lets you copy and paste previous notes.  Writing forces you to be
economical in what you choose to record.  Typing lets you copy and paste a
figure into your notes.  Writing forces you to recopy the figure from scratch.
Writing ultimately forces you to work with the information slowly and
deliberately, and hence you're more likely to remember.

Typing lulls you into a false security of being able to quickly search and
look up information.  Writing forces you to scan manually, and so you end up
reviewing more ancillary information while searching for what you really want.

I started out typing to record the deluge of information, but ultimately I
ended up writing so I'd exercise my memory every time I had to rewrite a fact.


## Scratch work

Draw diagrams and simple tables.  Don't transcribe everything; these notes
should be much simpler than your textbooks and review.  Only record 1-2 key
distinguishing facts.  Those key facts will jog your memory of additional
ancillary facts.

When you revisit a topic, try to reproduce (redraw) as much as you can from
memory.  Resist the urge to immediately flip back in your notes.  Every time
you stretch your recall, it strengthens those neurons.  Every time you redraw
a diagram, you'll get faster.  I was dumb as bricks when it came to metabolic
biochemistry.  Repeatedly redrawing metabolic pathways was the only way I
could get it through my thick skull.

Keep this all bound, in order (dated) in a notebook so you can flip back ("Oh,
I remember that from last week ... let me find that ...").  At the start of
each day's study session, skim your pages from yesterday or the day before.
Since these notes are all the things you got wrong or want to remember, this
is like a poor man's version of [spaced repetition][].

 [spaced repetition]: {% post_url 2014-05-07-top-students %}#spaced-repetition

No figure or table is sacred.  I often fall into the trap of trying to make
things pretty, or shying away from even starting a table or figure because I
think it'll be a mess.  Go fast and loose, and repeat frequently.




## When studying

**Control your environment, or it will control you.** If there's something
distracting, get rid of it.  If you are at a coffee shop distracted by
someone nearby, move your table or move to a different area.  If you're
attention keeps drifting to something outside the window, draw the shades or
move locations.  If you keep getting the impulse to check the news,
[block the website][focus].  Move to a high traffic location where fellow
students can see over your shoulder that you're goofing off.  Erect whatever
barriers are necessary to make studying the easy road.

**Unload distractions.** If you realize you need to do laundry, don't.
Instead, write that on a piece of paper for something to do during your
upcoming break.  Anything that is on your mind that's not about studying,
simply write it on this list to think about later.  The simple act of
writing something down and pushing that aside helps me de-clutter my mind.
When a distracting urge rises up, learn to say "No" to yourself.

**Set timers.** This will force you to be conscious of time and not simply let
study time fill all your time.  During the first half of medical school you
have plenty of time so you can study for hours, but during the clinical years
you have very little time and you need to get faster at covering material.
Use the clock to up your game.

**Be disciplined about short breaks.** Many times my 15min break would
easily stretch to 30, 45min.  Set a timer to kick you back in to gear when
the time comes.

**Use your breaks to re-energize.** While studying, make a list of what you
are looking forward to doing during your next break.  Plan fun things to
look forward to.  When I get really worn down and start dragging in my
studies, one remedy I use it to plan something super fun for the next break
or that evening.

**When Not Studying.** What you do outside your study time will affect what
you do during your study time.

- **Sleep.** Decrease stress and let your brain process the info you've fed it.
- **Exercise.** Decrease stress, release energy.

## STEP1

It will punish those who do not put in the time.  As a cumulative exam,
anything you failed to learn during your modules will show up here and cost
you points again.  If you didn't learn something the first time, now is your
last chance.

It is a test of endurance and discipline.  I'm not talking about test day.
I'm talking about endurance and discipline in the weeks leading up to test
day.  If you fail to work diligently during your dedicated period, you will be
punished.

It is also a very straight forward test for anyone willing to dedicate the
energy to working through question banks.

I would wager that simply completing something like 5000
questions easily puts you in the 240s.  You've simply seen just about every
way key topics can be tested.  The difference between the 240s and the 260s is
where active studying and critical self-assessment make the difference.
{% endcomment %}



**How badly do you want it?** All the tactics in the world are not going to
work if you don't have the motivation to push forward.  Strong motivation
energizes and fully engages your senses.  Step back and think about what you
want in a career and what you're willing to trade for it.  Do you want that
subspecialty residency so much that you're willing to prioritize weekend study
over social outings?

It's not just about a test score and getting into a top residency.  It's about
becoming the best physician possible.  It's about being able to answer patient
questions, explaining to them what's happening to their bodies.  It's about
being able to notice a disease pattern that others might have missed.

## Class or No-Class

* at the end of every MCQ test, before you submit, write down 3 things you're
  going to immediately look up that afternoon.  Go study those three things.

* review your test notice what type of mistakes you make (see SOM study
  booklet), note items that are repeated -- you'll see them again
   * write down 3-5 things you're going to immediately look up

* If something is covered in lecture that has little or no FA coverage, then
  don't spend much time on it.  Look for one or two testable nuggets and just
  passively listen to rest of lecture.  Yes, this may be on exam, but if so
  then it'll likely be a very clear question.  Professors will know stuff is
  not part of STEP and so tend to make these lectures very simple straight
  recall type questions.

   * David Young: "More than anything, Anki/FC help us avoid the number one
     error people make when studying: reading something you don't know but
     believing you really do. The open ended questions in FC will see if you
     really do remember the 11 criteria for SLE or the findings for beta
     thalassemia minor, whereas you may review that topic in FA and feel like
     you know it simply because the words are familiar. People who on exams
     consistently feel like all the questions are familiar and they know the
     answer but just cant think of it are probably falling into this
     category. This alone is probably what separates the all-honors students
     from the all-pass students. The ability to generate the answers on your
     own rather than recognize them with deja vu is critical, and FC takes aim
     at this directly." (from

## Spaced repetition

Spaced repetition provides the most efficient schedule for reviewing material,
but this schedule is separate from *how* you absorb the material.
