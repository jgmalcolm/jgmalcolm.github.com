Writing your first scientific paper for publication can be daunting.  In this
post, I go through my general process for what to consider in each section,
pitfalls to avoid, and how to handle the review process.

This all assumes you've got the bulk of the results done.  It's normal that as
you're writing, you come up with new experiments to prove out a point.  The
manuscript evolves.


## Write in order

**Start by drafting the abstract.** This will define the general trajectory:
research question, basic methods, highlighted result, conclusion.  The actual
paper of course has many details, and may include experiments and results not
mentioned in the abstract. As you start out, much of the abstract is unknown
and vague but still you should try to articulate in broad strokes what the
paper will set out to accomplish, how you intend to do it, and even speculate
about what you expect to find.  This abstract will evolve as the rest of the
manuscript does.  At this point, it should be enough that anyone coming to the
manuscript later -- coauthor or yourself -- can quickly come up to speed on
the project.

**Finish by polishing the abstract.** You'll return to this abstract time and
again, each time making sure it is in line with the rest of the paper.

**Follow the reader's eyes.** Always keep your reader in mind.  The first
thing they read is the title and abstract, so those need to be the most
polished pieces.  Between drafting the abstract and its final touches, write
in the order that they will read: right after reading the abstract, most
people skim the figures and tables.  From there, the methods, results, and
discussion.  For people familiar with a field, the conclusion and introduction
are of lesser importance.  Conclusions are often redundant and low quality
summaries, introductions are often filled with history you already know, and
both are of less importance than the abstract, methods, and results.

1. abstract (draft)
1. figures and tables
1. methods, results, discussion
1. conclusions and introduction
1. abstract (polish) and title




## Title

**Put your main conclusion in the title.** This is truly the first thing
anyone sees, so make it count.  If they remember nothing from your paper, they
at least know the main finding.

* Bad: "The effect of Tylenol on headache symptoms"
* Good: "Tylenol decreases headache symptoms"

**Title: Subtitle.** Take the liberty of breaking your title up to squeeze in
more information.  You could use the subtitle to describe the type of study.

* Good: "Tylenol decreases headache symptoms"
* Better: "Tylenol decreases headache symptoms: A randomized controlled trial"

**Avoid technical jargon.** Try to avoid acronyms where possible, unless it's
truly understood through the vast majority of your readership.  You want a
wide reader catchment.

**Gut check.** After reading just your title, reviewers will already have a
gut feeling of whether they are interested in a paper, and maybe even a bias
to accept/reject.



## Abstract

**It should stand alone.** Give some context, state the objective, summarize
the basic methods, relate the most important results, and draw conclusions.
Don't speculate.  Don't be vacuous and hint at what the article contains.
This abstract should contain the most juicy pieces without requiring the
casual reader to have to fetch the full document.

**Interested?** The abstract can either solidify or dissolve the reviewer's
interest.  By the end, a reviewer might already lean toward rejecting or
requesting re-submission with further details.




## Introduction

**Remember your readers.** Your readers are not students like yourself.  They
have been practicing science and performing surgery since you were in diapers.
Don't start at square one. Imagine as a graduate science major reading a paper
where the intro sentence talks about how "addition and subtraction are common
processes in mathematics" -- you'd roll your eyes and skim right past it.  A
wasted sentence.  Don't start your neurosurgery article telling the readers
that cranioplasty is putting back together the skull.  Don't start your
internal medicine paper telling the reader how diabetes involves the
pancreatic islet cells. Jump right into the meat with your first two
sentences.

**Don't discuss.** This is the introduction, not the discussion.  Don't be
exhaustive and cite everything. Just cite a few (2-3) major studies that
you're going to springboard off.  The discussion later can be a more
exhaustive literature review.  Similarly, leave the conclusion and results for
the conclusion and results sections.

**Too many citations.** The intro should be very basic and merely introduce
the topic.  You should even get away with making basic statements that don't
need citation. You don't want to overwhelm the reader with references they
need to screen.

**Why should we care?** You need to quickly justify the importance of your
project. How many people are affected? How bad is the disease on quality of
life? Has there been some recent change in methods or studies you are
exploiting?

**Give perspective.** How has this area evolved? What were some major changes
in the past decade?  Don't go back more than a decade though -- that's for a
history review, not a clinical article.

**Two paragraphs.** That's all you need.  The first paragraph introduces the
problem and some perspective on the past decade.  The second paragraph is even
shorter, maybe two-three sentences, where you clearly state the clinical
questions that form the goal of this present study.  Sometimes you can insert
a paragraph between these giving a review 2-3 studies you're comparing against
or building from.

**Don't oversell.** Avoid cliche terms like "novel", "unique", or "first
ever". It's all been done before in some form or fashion. You don't want some
tenured professor who's seen it all to pull a muscle after rolling her eyes.



## Methods

**Write for a knowledgeable reader.** Your audience should be familiar with
your research area.  They will likely have done similar projects, worked with
similar substances, done the procedure themselves, used the same statistical
tools.  This reader should be able to reproduce your experiments.

**Provide details.** You can almost never have too much. This goes back to
reproducibility: any constants, thresholds, or tuning parameters must be
included.  Every inclusion/exclusion decision you made. How long you waited to
check something.  If it's a very new procedure you're proposing with important
details you want people to reproduce, then consider submitting a supplemental
methods document.

## Results

- only essential results
- consider supplementary materials
- subheadings to group
- clearly answer questions at end of introduction
- order should mirror abstract & methods


## Figures & Tables

- use color sparingly
  - consider different line styles so looks okay in b&w
- include necessary color/intensity scales
- first sentence of caption tells you what you're looking at, second sentence
  tells you what to take away
- tables report data, figures show trends


## Discussion

- begin by contextualizing and summarizing in one paragraph
- talk to the audience
- do not introduce any new results here not already in results section
- compare your results to published results
- important to reference papers with different conclusions
  - if you don't include and reviewer finds, it will sink you because reviewer
    wonders 'what else is missing?'
- as you work on your project, keep a list of interesting papers and 1-2
  sentence summary of methods and results.  String these together into
  discussion paragraphs.
- where you can vent. You are now the expert. You can say whatever you believe
  is correct. It's your opinion. What advice do you have for those that follow
  your footsteps? What frustrations did you have during the study? Make some
  recommendations.  Anything you wish you'd done differently?


## Conclusions

- how does your work advance the field
- do not repeat abstract or list experimental results
- indicate applications or future directions or anything you are currently
  working on


## Acknowledgments

- advisors, proof-readers, anyone who helped conduct experiments but may not
  have been justified a co-author spot


## References

- Mendeley, EndNote, Zotero
- while writing, don't get bogged down (Smith2002, Johnson2010)
- too many references means you're unfocused
- too few and you haven't done homework
- look at representative papers to judge appropriate count




## When stuck

- ###

**Copy/paste.** When I'm a little unsure about how to present something, my
typical trick is to look at 3-5 examples and pick the one or two I like the
most.  Often I will literally copy/paste from another article, and then go
sentence by sentence using the same structure but rewriting completely using
my own data.  In the end there is zero plagiarism but you borrowed a structure
to get started.  As I continue revisiting and revising, eventually the text
becomes all my own and turns out completely unique from the initial
copy/paste.




## Responding to reviewers

- respond quickly, reviewer fatigue / context switching
- create a document with the reviews verbatim, reformat to be bold/italics,
  and answer inline with normal font
- make a separate checklist for you and co-authors, ordered by importance
  - keep going down that list until you judge not important
  - justify everything below that line
- start by thanking reviewer and highlighting what you appreciate
- never argue, guarantees failure
- reviewers may be quick/sloppy but they are never stupid and they are always
  "right"
- try to answer everything, but okay for minor points to acknowledge and
  justify not addressing.  Better to say you considered something and, while
  you didn't do exactly what is suggested, you did something similar.
