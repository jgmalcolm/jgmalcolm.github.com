Writing your first scientific paper for publication can be daunting.  In this
post, I go through my general process for what to consider in each section,
pitfalls to avoid, and how to handle the review process.

This all assumes you've got the bulk of the results done.  It's normal that as
you're writing, you come up with new experiments to prove out a point.  The
manuscript evolves.


## Write in order

**Start by drafting the abstract.** This will define the general trajectory:
research question, basic methods, highlighted result, conclusion.  The actual
paper of course has many details, and may include experiments and results not
mentioned in the abstract.

**Finish by polishing the abstract.** You'll return to this abstract time and
again, each time making sure it is in line with the rest of the paper.

**Follow the reader's eyes.** Always keep your reader in mind.  The first
thing they read is the title and abstract, so those need to be the most
polished pieces.  Between drafting the abstract and its final touches, write
in the order that they will read: right after reading the abstract, most
people skim the figures and tables.  From there, the methods, results, and
discussion.  For people familiar with a field, the conclusion and introduction
are of lesser importance.  Conclusions are often redundant and low quality
summaries, introductions are often filled with history you already know, and
both are of less importance than the abstract, methods, and results.

1. abstract (draft)
1. figures and tables
1. methods, results, discussion
1. conclusions and introduction
1. abstract (polish) and title




## Title

**Put your main conclusion in the title.** This is truly the first thing
anyone sees, so make it count.  If they remember nothing from your paper, they
at least know the main finding.

* Bad: "The effect of Tylenol on headache symptoms"
* Good: "Tylenol decreases headache symptoms"

**Title: Subtitle.** Take the liberty of breaking your title up to squeeze in
more information.  You could use the subtitle to describe the type of study.

* Good: "Tylenol decreases headache symptoms"
* Better: "Tylenol decreases headache symptoms: A randomized controlled trial"

**Avoid technical jargon.** Try to avoid acronyms where possible, unless it's
truly understood through the vast majority of your readership.  You want a
wide reader catchment.

**Gut check.** After reading just your title, reviewers will already have a
gut feeling of whether they are interested in a paper, and maybe even a bias
to accept/reject.

## Abstract

- should stand alone
- will solidify or dissolve the reviewer's level of interest
  - by the end, reviewers probably decide whether reject or resubmit


## Introduction

- why should we care
- give perspective
- introduce main issues
- two paragraphs
  - first: give perspective
  - second: clearly state 1-2 clinical questions that form goal of study
- bad examples
  - including discussion, conclusion, results
  - history lessons better left to a review
  - oversell - 'novel', 'unique', 'first ever'


## Methods

- knowledgeable reader must be able to reproduce experiments
  - details, lots of details
  - consider supplementary materials


## Results

- only essential results
- consider supplementary materials
- subheadings to group
- clearly answer questions at end of introduction
- order should mirror abstract & methods


## Figures & Tables

- use color sparingly
  - consider different line styles so looks okay in b&w
- include necessary color/intensity scales
- first sentence of caption tells you what you're looking at, second sentence
  tells you what to take away
- tables report data, figures show trends


## Discussion

- talk to the audience
- do not introduce any new results here not already in results section
- compare your results to published results
- important to reference papers with different conclusions
  - if you don't include and reviewer finds, it will sink you because reviewer
    wonders 'what else is missing?'


## Conclusions

- how does your work advance the field
- do not repeat abstract or list experimental results
- indicate applications or future directions or anything you are currently
  working on


## Acknowledgments

- advisors, proof-readers, anyone who helped conduct experiments but may not
  have been justified a co-author spot


## References

- Mendeley, EndNote
- while writing, don't get bogged down (Smith2002, Johnson2010)
- too many references means you're unfocused
- too few and you haven't done homework
- look at representative papers to judge appropriate count



## Responding to reviewers

- create a document with the reviews verbatim, reformat to be bold/italics,
  and answer inline with normal font
- make a separate checklist for you and co-authors, ordered by importance
  - keep going down that list until you judge not important
  - justify everything below that line
- start by thanking reviewer and highlighting what you appreciate
- never argue, guarantees failure
- reviewers may be quick/sloppy but they are never stupid and they are always
  "right"
- try to answer everything, but okay for minor points to acknowledge and
  justify not addressing.  Better to say you considered something and, while
  you didn't do exactly what is suggested, you did something similar.
