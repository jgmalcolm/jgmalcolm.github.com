title: Free medical dictionary for Microsoft Office
---

Getting tired of seeing red squiggly marks under your diverticula and
granulomas?  Install a free medical dictionary for Microsoft Office.

1. First, download the [free dictionary][www].  The instructions on that page
   are for older versions of Office so keep following along.  Save the file
   somewhere permanent, like where Office puts all its own dictionaries.  On
   Mac OSX, this would be /User/\<username\>/Library/Application
   Support/Microsoft/Office/Preferences/Office 2011/

2. Open up Word and any document (blank or existing).

3. For Mac OSX,
   Preferences &rarr;
   Spelling and Grammar &rarr;
   Custom dictionary &rarr;
   Dictionaries ... &rarr;
   Add ...

   Note you may need to use the 'Enable' popup to see your dictionary
   depending on its filename extension.

4. For Windows,
   File &rarr;
   Options &rarr;
   Proofing &rarr;
   Custom Dictionaries &rarr;
   Add


This one change handles all the Office tools: Word, PowerPoint, Outlook, Excel.
