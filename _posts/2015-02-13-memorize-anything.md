Many fields require students to memorize some basic set of facts at the start.
With those planted in memory, you progress to learning how to reason.  This
article outlines simple steps for committing seemingly random facts to memory
using your powerful visual and emotional senses.

## Simple

**Use what immediately pops into your head.** Run with that natural
association, eg.  penicillin = pencil.

**Stew on it.** If nothing immediately comes to mind, don't be afraid to mull
around for a while until you find something that really fits.  Play with the
word some.  Roll it around in your mouth.  Pronounce it in various ways.  Look
for a synonym.  Instead of representing the word directly, represent a key
fact about the concept.  Use a dictionary to find other words that begin with
the same first few letters.

**Trigger off most characteristic syllable.** Unless every syllable is
important, just use the one with most emphasis.

**Use easily recognizable objects.** If the object is too complicated or
unusually decorated, it might get blurred in your visual memory.  Use dynamic
action to make things memorable.

**Only include salient features.** Ignore details in the initial stages.  As
you become an expert in a topic, the details just naturally associate with the
topic in your mind.  There is less need to fit them in at the beginning of
scene formation.

**Consistency.** Aim for all your facts to be roughly the same size.  If some
of your objects are huge and some are tiny, your mind's eye may be overwhelmed
by the huge objects and forget all the tiny details.



## Vivid pictures

**Visceral and emotional.** In order to get as many brain cells firing as
possible, you need to evoke visceral or emotional reactions.  Gross blood,
smelly fish, painful wounds, a deflated ego, a guilty conscience, an
attractive person.

**Dynamic scenes.** Use action to get your attention.  A bunch of independent,
static objects can become a fragmented blur.  A bunch of interactive objects
and moving actors will stick.

**Make it real to you.** Walk around it to see it from all sides.  Push
something around.  Focus on details.  Smell, taste, and touch.



## Context

**Pick a theme for your scene.** Come up with a consistent theme for all your
objects.  This common theme will reinforce the connections binding all your
symbols together.  What's in the background of the scene?

For example, if you recall that the entire scene was set in a farm field but
you're forgetting one area, you have a better chance of narrowing it down as
you try to recall common farm objects likely present.  If the scene had been
too ridiculous and involved completely unrelated objects, then good luck.
You're screwed.

**Avoid clutter.** Too many symbols and they'll mush together.  Spread them
out.  Split it up into multiple scenes, and reuse some symbols to link the
scenes.

## Numbers
  * In [Mnemonic Major System][wiki] each digit maps to a unique consonant.
    To remember a sequence of digits, start with the consonants mapped from
    each digit and form a memorable word by adding vowels as needed.

## Sequences

* Sequences require a "memory palace" to provide order.
* A very familiar location (home, school)
  * Separate rooms and physical space to avoid crowding
  * Aim for about five objects per a space.
* Spend time walking through this space and examining the "stopping spots"
  where you will later place objects.

## Getting faster

There is an up-front cost of time spent generating a scene, but I've found
that I don't have to restudy material which saves me time overall.  Even more,
as I've practiced constructing scenes, the process has become faster.  I'm
faster now at coming up with symbols, associations, and an integrated scene.

Spaced repetition is an efficient algorithm for scheduling when to revisit a
weak topic, but it does nothing to help you when you're actually trying to
absorb the specific topic material.  Sometimes I felt like I was getting hit
in head with a hammer repeatedly every time I encountered the same topic day
after day, each time unable to actually absorb and assimilate the details for
any meaningful retention.

Spend time reviewing and interacting with your mental scenes.  Close your eyes
and walk through them.  As you review, reach out to touch every object to make
it real, as if you're there in the scene.
