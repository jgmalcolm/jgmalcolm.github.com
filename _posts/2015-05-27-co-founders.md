Building a new business is exciting, but there are important things to
consider as you form the founding team, whether with friends, existing
business partners, or a significant other. Here I share some tips based on
experience creating [AccelerEyes](//arrayfire.com).

## Summary

1. <a href="#personal">Personal</a>: work with a responsible person you like
   and share values with.
2. <a href="#equity">Equity</a>: split equally, earn it out, and maximize
   value for all.
3. <a href="#competencies">Competencies</a>: think what is needed and what you
   can get better at.
4. <a href="#run-through-scenarios">Scenarios</a>: plan for inevitable
   contingencies and fights.
5. <a href="#your-worst-enemy">Your worst enemy</a>: pre-emptively and
   explicitly plan for the worst.

## Personal

**Is this someone you like working with?** Can you see yourself working
together at 3 am under a deadline?  Do they annoy you?  These are probably
some of the most important questions that will determine your happiness.
While having an annoying partner is not a deal breaker, the baseline
aggravation can trigger bigger issues later.

**Is this person responsible?** Is this someone you trust to work hard and get
the job done?  The nature of forming a partnership is because you need to
spread work out, so you need to be able to trust that your partner will
execute on their fair share.

**Do you share the same sense of values?** Do you question their judgment?
Have you witnessed or heard about them doing anything ethically questionable?
If so, be blunt and ask them about it.  Better to air the matter now rather
than after you've formed a joint bank account.

It's been said that business partnerships are like a marriage without the
benefits.  You will be very close to your partners - as close as family.
Choose your associates wisely.


## Equity

> are correct.  *(Dune, book 1)*

**Equal split is best, unless you have a strong reason otherwise.** Anything
other than equal will create a subtle imbalance.  The minor partners will feel
less responsibility and show less initiative. Some days you'll be the slug,
and on those days you want to know that your partners are picking up the
slack.

Even if one partner clearly brings more to the venture, think long and hard
about tipping this balance.  You never know what the future holds, and likely
you'll all end up growing in your rolls.

Instead of creating an imbalance from the start, look at the core competences
and areas of the business and come up with a rough split that allows the
would-be minor members to grow.

**When to consider unequal splits.** There are good reasons to consider an
unequal split.  One partner might bring significant industry and operational
experience, financial resources and capitalization, or simply putting more
time into the project.

**Earn out.** Avoid granting all equity up front.  Instead, equity should be
granted over years (4-5 years is common because it typically takes about that
long to prove out a venture).  I've seen companies trapped in an equity
arrangement with a partner who abandons the project while keeping the original
equity locked; these typically end in a dissolution of assets and
re-incorporation.  What a waste of time and energy.  Bake in an agreement that
[rewards partners for sticking around][vesting], leaves open the option for
fairly compensating partners that decide to walk away, and protects the
corporation through all of this.

**Equity alternatives.** Maybe you want to avoid equity altogether.  One
option is for the minor partner to be paid hourly while the major partner
retains equity.  If things are pre-revenue, maybe the minor partner could be
guaranteed hourly pay from the first profits that roll in.  Maybe the minor
partner could "earn" equity over time.

**Maximize value for all partners.** Whatever you do, the goal is to ensure
that all partners can contribute as much as possible to the venture while
feeling fairly compensated for those efforts.




## Competencies

**What core competencies are needed for the venture?** Make a list.  Who
brings what?  Who's responsible for what?  Think through the entire pipeline
of your business, from sales and marketing to back end production and
operations.  Also consider ancillary tasks such as taxes and pay roll.

**What do you need to get better at?** Some things you stink at, can't (yet)
outsource, or will need to learn yourself.  Make a plan for how that will
happen.



## Run through scenarios

**What happens if one partner walks?** Who gets what?  What if it's after one
year, two, or four?  Consider specific scenarios if you can: if you're both in
school, what happens after graduation?  What if you stay and the other partner
leaves for a big fancy job?  What about continuing work remotely?  What if
you are both balancing school or a job?

**What level of involvement is required to remain a partner?** How and when
will you evaluate?  What's the process for pushing a partner out?

**What happens when we don't agree?** Do you have a respected mentor or
arbiter?  [Disagreements and fights are inevitable][aaronkharris], so start a
conversation early about how you'd like to handle when the inevitable happens.
A few gentle, proactive discussions can significantly reduce the pain if things go off the rails.

## Your worst enemy

Ask yourself these questions:

+ what if this partner was your worst enemy?
+ how would you split up assets if you needed to divorce?
+ what about assets you brought to capitalize the business?
+ how would profits be disbursed?
+ if you left early, how can you get your money back?
+ if you caught them cheating, how would you deal with it?

Don't just gloss over holes in the contract and assume you both understand
what it means.  Make things explicit where you can.
