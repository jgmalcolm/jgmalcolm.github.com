## Functional & Stereotactic

- Before you move the Leksel frame, make sure there are no probes inserted
  into the brain. Not only does that damage tissue but also bends your probes.

- **Hemostasis before proceeding.** When working through a stereotactic burr
  hole, don't place your don't place your stabilizing plate or cover until you
  have hemostasis. Same for any procedure where you're operating down a deep
  dark hole. Control even a trickle hemorrhage from the galea before moving
  forward. Otherwise you'll be fighting for visibility.



## Emergency craniotomy

- **Which side?** While everyone is scrambling to setup, you need to be
  repeating to yourself which side you're operating on (left or right),
  because if you screw that up, you will be famous.  Let everyone do their job
  while you calmly confirm imaging and mentally rehearse.  Don't operate on
  the wrong side.
