## Your relationship with scrub tech and circulator

- **Enunciate.** Don't mumble.  State clearly what you want.  Also state
  clearly what you will want soon.  Be consistent in how you ask for each
  category: "may I have 3 punch please", "we will need a 3 punch soon".
  Whatever feels natural, keep doing it that way so that the scrub tech can
  recognize the key phrase even when they are turned to the back table.

- **Please and thank you.** When things are slow and smooth, adding these
  little niceties now and then keeps things pleasant.  When things are moving
  fast, it's understandable there is no time and these phrases should be
  dropped for efficiency, or simply when it seems excessive.  It's all about
  respect and appreciation.

- **Gently state your preference.** Scrub techs are obsessive about clearing
  the instruments off the near field and putting them back on the mayo stand
  or back table.  If you're going to be going between two instruments over and
  over, ask "may I place this here for a moment" to indicate you want an
  instrument to remain nearby and not be cleared right away.  Follow up soon
  to "release" the instrument back to the tech, and thank them for allowing
  you to hang onto it longer.  It's just good to show deference here.  They
  are doing their best to keep an orderly environment.  Don't make it a power
  struggle.


## Functional & Stereotactic

- Before you move the Leksel frame, make sure there are no probes inserted
  into the brain. Not only does that damage tissue but also bends your probes.

- **Hemostasis before proceeding.** When working through a stereotactic burr
  hole, don't place your don't place your stabilizing plate or cover until you
  have hemostasis. Same for any procedure where you're operating down a deep
  dark hole. Control even a trickle hemorrhage from the galea before moving
  forward. Otherwise you'll be fighting for visibility.



## Emergency craniotomy

- **Which side?** While everyone is scrambling to setup, you need to be
  repeating to yourself which side you're operating on (left or right),
  because if you screw that up, you will be famous.  Let everyone do their job
  while you calmly confirm imaging and mentally rehearse.  Don't operate on
  the wrong side.
