True story: Two students go to the library Saturday morning right when it
opens.  Instead of enjoying the beautiful weather, both students work hard
until the library closes.  Here's the kicker: they put in the *same amount of
time but I bet they likely each learned very different amounts of material*.
Same input but very different output.

We live in unprecedented times.  This generation more than ever has the
opportunity to delay entering the workforce in order to develop skills.  The
tools and technology at our fingertips blow away anything available 20 years
ago: laptops, mobile, online tutorials, search.  Human potential is boundless,
and it's a shame when anyone squanders the opportunity to learn.

This is a big topic, and these are just some cursory thoughts.  There's a lot
of "right" ways to study, but there are even more "wrong" ways, so if your
grades suck, then you're probably doing it the "wrong" way.

## Excuses

We often look at high achievers and see them as different.  We rationalize why
they're doing so well: they were a Bio major so they've already seen this med
school stuff before, all they do is study so they won't have anything cool on
their resume, they've just got more brains, etc.  These are all excuses.
Recognize them as such and instead find inspiration.  So what if they are
better?  That's got nothing to do with your success but relying on excuses is
one way to guarantee failure.

## Focus

Top students don't endlessly peruse their Facebook feed several times an hour.
Your job is to learn.  Your job is not to check email.  You're not going to
get an A because you checked email a lot or had the most pithy tweets.  Your
job is not to carry on text message conversations throughout the day.  All of
those things are secondary to learning.  All of those things in fact take away
from learning.  They cause you to break focus, and then it takes time to get
back in the zone.  Your output is a function of both time and [intensity].
Instead of checking your phone between classes, put your phone in your locker
and only check it during lunch.

Another secret weapon of mine is software that simply blocks internet
connection to certain sites ([SelfControl] for Mac OSX, [ColdTurkey] for
Windows).  Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, Buzzfeed, Upworthy,
ICanHasCheezburger ... whatever is your thing...block it.

## Time

Top students simply put in the time.  There are no shortcuts here.  They
consistently schedule and prioritize blocks of study time.  Not just 30min
here and 1hr there, but big chunks of time.  They treat it like a job
consistently starting in the morning and continuing the full day.  Taking off
an afternoon or a long lunch here and there is important, but not the norm.


## Synthesis

Top students have a knack for understanding what is important, and what is
just context.  Their study time is active learning.  Creating your own study
guide will force you to wrestle with the material in a way that passively
reading doesn't achieve.  Underlining key words or phrases focuses your
attention.  [Recent studies][hand-written] show that hand written notes are
more effective than typed.

In addition to knowing what's important, top students seek to understand.
Memorizing only provides short-term results.  You've probably heard that
knowledge is like a tree: you fill in the branches, then the leaves.  Taking
the time to understand *Why* something is the way it is will last much longer
than simply *What* something is.

## Testing

Reading the same material over and over bores me.  My mind often drifts and my
energy wanes.  I've found that I'm most engaged when I'm doing practice
questions.  Instead of passively reading and nodding along, doing a few
practice questions and getting stuff *wrong* gets my attention.  There's
plenty of research into this [testing effect].

Doing practice problems also helps me keep clear on what's important.  What's
important testable material and what's just context.  While doing these
practice sets, I try to refer to the study guides I created and make marks to
indicate what material came up in questions.  Put a small dot in the margin
every time a question hit on a concept, and then you'll quickly start to see
what are the high yield topics.

## Spaced repetition

Making a study guide is a good start, but you need to circle back to study
that study guide.  Not only that, when you circle back matters.  Knowledge
tends to drop off on a curve: 1hr spent reviewing 24hrs after lecture is more
effective than 1hr spent 5 days later.  [Spaced Repetition][wiki-sr] is a
technique that attempts to model this timing to queue up review items when
most effective.  There are great flashcard systems like [Anki] that implement
these models and provide cute graphs and numbers so you can
[gamify learning][gamify].  For standardized classes, chances are someone
[already created the deck][decks] you want to study,
e.g. [med school boards][usmle].  Read more about [incremental learning] and

## Balance

School isn't everything, and you'll be punished if you try to make it so.
Find what balance means for you.  What makes you happy?  I found that I like
to leave all my books at school and do all my studying there.  Now I feel so
relaxed when I get home.  I make work/school a distraction-free environment,
and home is my personal space.  Having strong barriers defining zones of study
and relaxation helps me [avoid burnout][burnout].

Get good [sleep].  Figure out personally how much sleep you need to
consistently feel 100%.  I'm not impressed when I hear people brag about
running on X hours of sleep.  I've done that plenty myself, and I've found my
mood and energy sub par for a day or two after.  In other words, a few extra
hours of cramming can often affect an entire day or two after.

## Parting thoughts

Don't expect to become a top student over night, but you should be better than
you were yesterday.  Pick a few of the tips above and run with it.  Stop
wasting your Saturdays, and start studying hard so you can play hard.

Lots more could be written on the topic, and I'm sure I'll come back to it.
I'm constantly trying new things, borrowing from the best, mixing and matching
to suit my personality, always trying to become better.

What works for you?
